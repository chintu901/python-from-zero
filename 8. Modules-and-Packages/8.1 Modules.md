# Modules and Packages

A module in Python is a file that contains Python code such as **functions**, **classes**, and **variables**. It is used to organize related code in a **single place** so that it can be **reused in other programs**. Any file with the `.py` extension can be considered a module. By using modules, programmers can break large programs into smaller, manageable parts and import them whenever needed.

For example, when building a ping pong game, one module may be responsible for the game logic, and another module draws the game on the screen. Each module consists of a different file, which may be edited separately.

**Eaxmple programe:**

We will create two modules (files):
- One for game logic
- One for drawing the game

`📁 File 1: game_logic.py` (👉 This module handles the game rules and logic)

``` python
# game_logic.py

# Ball position
ball_x = 0
ball_speed = 1

def move_ball():
    global ball_x
    ball_x += ball_speed
    return ball_x

def check_collision():
    if ball_x > 10:
        return "Ball hit the wall!"
    return "Ball moving..."
```

`📁 File 2: game_draw.py` (👉 This module is responsible for drawing the game)

``` python
# game_draw.py

def draw_ball(position):
    print("Ball position:", position)
```

`📁 File 3: main.py` (👉 This is the main program that uses both modules)

``` python
# main.py

import game_logic
import game_draw

for i in range(5):
    pos = game_logic.move_ball()
    game_draw.draw_ball(pos)
    print(game_logic.check_collision())
```

> [!NOTE]
> Modules let you split a big program into multiple files, where each file handles a specific task like logic, graphics, or input.

## Types of Modules in Python

Python modules can be grouped into different types based on **where they come from and how they are used**.

### 1) Built-in Modules

Built-in modules are modules that are **already available** inside Python. You do not need to install them because they come **preloaded with Python**. These modules provide basic features that Python needs to work efficiently.

Example:

``` python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))   # Output: 4.0
```
Here, `math` is a built-in module that provides mathematical functions.

### 2) Standard Library Modules

Standard library modules are included with Python when you install it. They help you perform common tasks like **working with files**, **dates**, **operating systems**, and **data formats**. These modules save you from writing complex code from scratch.

Example:

``` python
import datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
print(today)
```
The `datetime` module is part of the Python standard library.

### 3) User-Defined Modules

User-defined modules are modules that **you create yourself**. When your program becomes large, you can store functions and classes in separate files and reuse them in other programs.

Example:

`file: my_module.py`
``` python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello", name)
```

`file: main.py`

``` python
import my_module

my_module.greet("Alex")
```
Here, `my_module` is a user-defined module.

### 4) Third-Party Modules

Third-party modules are **created by other developers** and are not included with Python. You install them using `pip`. These modules add powerful features to Python.

Example:

``` python
pip install requests
```
``` pyhton
import requests

response = requests.get("https://example.com")
print(response.status_code)
```
`requests` is a popular third-party module used for web requests.

>[!NOTE]
> Python modules can be built-in, standard library, user-defined, or third-party. They help you reuse code, organize programs, and extend Python’s capabilities.

## Importing Modules in Python

In Python, importing a module means **using code written in another file or library inside your program**. Instead of rewriting the same functions and classes again, you import them and reuse them. This is one of the main reasons Python is powerful and professional-friendly.

When you import a module, Python loads that file and gives you access to its functions, variables, and classes.

### Different ways to import modules

Python provides different ways to import modules, depending on how you want to use them.

The simplest way is using the `import` keyword. This imports the **entire module**, and you access its content using the **module name**.

``` python
import math

print(math.sqrt(25))    # 5.0
```
Sometimes, module names are long, so Python allows **aliasing**. Alias means giving a **module a short name**.

``` python
import math as m

print(m.pi)
```
You can also **import specific functions or variables** from a module. This avoids writing the module name again and again.

``` python
from math import sqrt, pi

print(sqrt(55))
print(pi)
```
Here, you directly use `sqrt` and `pi` without writing `math.`.

If you want to import **everything** from a module, you can use `*`, but this is not recommended in professional code because it can cause confusion.

``` python
from math import *

print(sqrt(37))
```

You can also import **user-defined modules** (your own files). For example, if you have a file named `my_module.py`, you can import it like this:

``` python
import my_module

my_module.greet("Alex")
```
