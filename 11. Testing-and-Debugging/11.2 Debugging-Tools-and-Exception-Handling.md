# Debugging Tools & Exception Handling

## Using Python Debugger (`pdb`)

While `print()` debugging is useful, professional developers use debugging tools that allow them to **pause execution** and **inspect code interactively**. Python provides a built-in debugger called `pdb`.

The Python Debugger allows you to:
- Pause execution at a specific line
- Inspect variable values
- Execute code step-by-step
- Control program flow

This gives you much more control than simple print statements.

**Starting the Debugger**

You can start `pdb` in different ways.

**Method 1:** Inserting Breakpoint in Code (Recommended in Modern Python)

``` python
def divide(a, b):
    breakpoint()
    return a / b

print(divide(10, 2))
```
When execution reaches `breakpoint()`, Python pauses and enters debug mode.

**Method 2:** Using `pdb` Module Directly

``` python
import pdb

pdb.set_trace()
```
**Common `pdb` Commands**

When the debugger starts, you can type commands:

| Command | Meaning | 
|-------|-----|
| `n` | Next line | 
| `s` | Step into function | 
| `c` | Continue execution | 
| `q` | Quit debugger | 
| `p variable` | Print variable value | 
| `l` | List surrounding code | 

Example:

``` css
(Pdb) p a
10
(Pdb) p b
2
```
When to Use `pdb`
- When print debugging becomes messy
- When you need step-by-step inspection
- When dealing with unexpected runtime behavior
