# Data Types Basic

Data types define **what kind of value a variable can store** in a program. They tell Python how to **store the data in memory** and what **operations can be performed** on that data.

In simple words, a data type describes the **type of information** a variable holds, such as numbers, text, or collections of values.

Data types are important in python becouse:

- They help Python understand how to process data.

- They decide what operations are allowed on a value.

- They help prevent logical errors in programs.

- They make code easier to read and understand.

``` python
x = 2       # Int data type
y = 2.5     # Float data type
z = "Two"   # String data type
```

**Dynamic Data Typing in Python**

Python is an dynamically typed langauge, which means you do not need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. Python automatically decides the data type based on the value assigned.

``` python
x = 10  # Int data type
print(type(x))  # Output: Integer

x = "Ten"   # String data type
print(type(x))  # Output: String
