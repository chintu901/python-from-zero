# Input and Output

In programming, input and output are the ways a program interacts with the user.

- **Input** is the data that a program receives from the user or another source.

- **Output** is the data that a program displays or sends after processing the input.

Without input and output, a program would not be able to communicate or be useful.

## Input()

Input allows the user to **provide information** to the program while it is running. In Python, this is commonly done using the `input()` function.

`input()` is used to take input as long as it reached end of line.Note that there should not be any spaces.Taking input terminates with a new line character and if there are any spaces in the input line it results in error

``` python
# greet user name recived from the stdin (standard input)
user = input() # give rohit as input
print(f"Hello {user}") # Output: Hello rohit
```
> [!NOTE]
> The `input()` function always returns data as a `string`, even if the user enters a number.

**Type Conversion with Input:**

Since input is received as a string, you often need to **convert it to another data type** (like `int()`, `float()`) before performing operations like calculations.

``` python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

x = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
y = int(input("Enter a number: "))

print(add(x, y))
```

> Note: To convert the input into a float, you can use this `float(input())`.


## Output in Python

Output in Python is used to **display information** to the user. The most common way to produce output is by using the `print()` function.

**Using the print() Function**

``` python
name = "Mohit"
age = 21
print("Name: ", name)
print("Age: ", age)
```

**Printing Multiple Values**

``` python
x = 20
y = 30
print(x,y)
```

## Formatting Output

Formatting output means **controlling how data is displayed** on the screen to make it clear and readable.

**Using `print()`:**

``` python
name = "Alex"
age = 20
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)
```

Output:

``` bash
Name: Alex Age: 20
```

**Using `sep` (Separator):**

The `sep` parameter defines what separates printed values.

``` python
print("10", "08", "2015", sep = "-")
```

Output:

``` bash
10-08-2015
```

**Using `end`:**

The `end` parameter controls what is printed at the end of the line.

``` python 
print("Hello", end = " ")
print("World")
```

Output:

``` bash
Hello World
```

> [!NOTE]
> This will print `Hello World` instead of printing Hello and World on different lines because every value of print() ends with a '\n' which we replace with `" "` using `end`.

**Using the `%` Operator:**

Use `%` followed by format specifiers to embed values in a string.

``` python
Name = "Mohit"
Age = 21
Hight = 5.540

print("Name: %s, Age: %d, Hight: %.2f" % (Name, Age, Hight))
```

Output:

``` bash
Name: Mohit, Age: 21, Hight: 5.54
```

> [!NOTE]
> The standard format conversion guidelines used by Python's. `%s` for string format, `%d` for integer, `%.2f` for floating - point number and `.2` only print two digit after `.` in number. 

**Using f-Strings (Python 3.6+):**

f-strings are a **simple and powerful way to format output** in Python. They allow you to insert variables and expressions directly inside strings.

The best way to write the `print()` function in modern Python is by using `f-strings`, and this is also what professional developers prefer in most cases.

To create an f-string, place the letter `f` before the string and use `{}` to include variables.

``` python
name = "Alex"
age = 20
print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.")
```

Output:

``` bash
Hello Alex, you are 20 years old.
```

## Escape Characters in Output

Escape characters are special characters used to format text output in Python. They start with a backslash (`\`).

**Common Escape Characters**

| Escape Character | Meaning |
|-------|-----|
| `\n` | New line |
| `\t` | Tab space |
| `\\` | Backslash |
| `\'` | Single quote |
| `\"` | Double quote |

``` python
name = "Alex"
age = 21
print(f"Name: {name}\nAge: {age}")
```

Output:

``` bash
Name: Alex
Age: 21
```

Key Point

> Escape characters help control how text appears on the screen.

Using escape characters and f-strings together helps you create clean and professional output.
