# Input and Output

In programming, input and output are the ways a program interacts with the user.

- **Input** is the data that a program receives from the user or another source.

- **Output** is the data that a program displays or sends after processing the input.

Without input and output, a program would not be able to communicate or be useful.

## Input()

Input allows the user to **provide information** to the program while it is running. In Python, this is commonly done using the `input()` function.

`input()` is used to take input as long as it reached end of line.Note that there should not be any spaces.Taking input terminates with a new line character and if there are any spaces in the input line it results in error

``` python
# greet user name recived from the stdin (standard input)
user = input() # give rohit as input
print(f"Hello {user}") # Output: Hello rohit
```
> [!NOTE]
> The `input()` function always returns data as a `string`, even if the user enters a number.

**Type Conversion with Input:**

Since input is received as a string, you often need to **convert it to another data type** (like `int()`, `float()`) before performing operations like calculations.

``` python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

x = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
y = int(input("Enter a number: "))

print(add(x, y))
```

> Note: To convert the input into a float, you can use this `float(input())`.
