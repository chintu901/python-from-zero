# Logical Operations

Logical operations are used to **combine**, **evaluate**, and **control multiple conditions** in a program.
Instead of checking just one condition at a time, logical operations allow a program to **think** in terms of “and”, “or”, and “not”, similar to human reasoning.

Programs need logical decisions because real-world problems are rarely based on a single condition. For example:
- granting access to user after logged in.
- have the correct role. 
- discount may apply if a customer is a student or a senior.
Logical operations make it possible to express such combined rules clearly and accurately.

> [!NOTE]
> Logical operations allow programs to combine conditions and make meaningful decisions using Boolean logic.

## The `and` Operator

The `and` operator is used when **all conditions** must be true for the final result to be true.
It reflects situations where **multiple requirements** need to be satisfied at the same time.

``` python
age = 20
has_id = True

print(age >= 18 and has_id)     # True
```

## The `or` Operator

The `or` operator is used when at **least one condition must be true** for the overall result to be true.
It represents **flexible decision-making**, where multiple acceptable options exist.

When Python evaluates an `or` expression, it checks the conditions and returns `True` if any one of them is `True`. The result is `False` only when all conditions are `False`.

``` python
is_student = False
is_senior = True

print(is_student or is_senior)  # True
```

## The `not` Operator

The `not` operator is used to reverse a **Boolean value**.
It changes `True` to `False` and `False` to `True`.

Unlike `and` and `or`, which combine **multiple conditions**, `not` works on a **single Boolean expression**.

``` python
is_logged_in = False
print(not is_logged_in)     # True
```

## Logical Expressions in Conditions

Logical expressions are created by **combining comparison operators with logical operators**.
They allow a program to evaluate **complex conditions** that reflect real-world rules more accurately.

In practice, most decisions in a program are not based on a single comparison. Instead, they involve checking **multiple conditions** together, such as:
- validating input ranges
- checking permissions
- controlling program flow.

``` python
age = 22
has_license = True

print(age >= 18 and has_license)
```

Using Parentheses:

``` python
score = 85
print((score >= 50 and score <= 100) or score == 0)
```

## Short-Circuit Behavior

Short-circuit behavior means that Python **stops evaluating** a logical expression as soon as the result is known.
This makes logical operations more efficient and safer.

**How Short-Circuiting Works**

- With `and`: If the first condition is `False`, Python does not check the remaining conditions.

- With `or`: If the first condition is `True`, Python does not check the remaining conditions.
