# Inheritance in Python

**Inheritance** is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming that allows **one class to reuse the code of another class**. In simple words, a new class can take **properties** and **behaviors** from an existing class instead of writing everything again.

The class that provides the code is called the **parent class** (or base class), and the class that receives the code is called the **child class** (or derived class).

Inheritance exists to reduce **code repetition**, **make programs organized**, and **allow easy expansion of features**. Without inheritance, you would have to copy the same code again and again, which makes programs harder to maintain and more error-prone.

For example, imagine you have a Vehicle class with common features like speed and start/stop methods. Cars, bikes, and buses all share these features. Instead of writing the same code for Car, Bike, and Bus, you can make them inherit from Vehicle.

``` python
class Animal:
    def start(self):
        print("Animals can walk!!")

class Dog(Animal):
    pass

c = Dog()
c.start()   # Animals can walk!!
```

Here, the `Dog` class automatically gets the start method from the `Animal` class. This means `Dog` inherits behavior from `Animal`.

## Parent Class and Child Class Concept

In inheritance, the **parent class** is the class that provides **common data** and **behavior**, and the **child class** is the class that **receives** and **uses that data and behavior**. The parent class is also called the **base class**, and the child class is called the **derived class**.

The parent class usually **contains general features that many classes can share**. The child class represents a more specific version of the parent and can also add its own features. This helps you build programs in a hierarchical way, just like real life. For example, “Vehicle” is a general concept, while “Car” and “Bike” are specific types of vehicles.

``` python
class Vehicle:          # parent class
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle started")

class Car(Vehicle):      # child class
    def drive(self):
        print("Car is driving")

c = Car()
c.start()   # inherited from Vehicle
c.drive()   # defined in Car
```

> [!NOTE]
> The parent class provides common features, and the child class inherits those features and can add its own behavior, creating a clear and reusable class hierarchy.

## Creating a Child Class in Python

To create a child class in Python, you write the parent class name inside parentheses after the child class name. This tells Python that the new class should inherit features from the parent class.

This concept exists because many classes share common behavior. Instead of rewriting the same code, you build a child class on top of an existing parent class and only add what is new.

``` python
class Animal():
    def eat(self):
        print("Hummmm..mm")

class dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Woff")
```
Here, `Dog` is a child class of Animal. The `Dog` class does not redefine `eat`, but it still has that method because it inherits from `Animal`.

You can create an object of the child class like this:
``` python
obj.dog()
obj.eat()   # Hummmm..mm
obj.bark()  # Wolf
```

## Inheriting Attributes and Methods

When a child class inherits from a parent class, it **automatically gets all public and protected attributes and methods of the parent**. This means you can use parent variables and functions inside the child class without rewriting them.

Example with attributes and methods:

``` python
class person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def show_name(self):
        print("Name:", self.name)
class student(person):
    def study(person):
        print(self.name, "is studying")
```

Using child class

``` python
c = student("Rahul")
c.show_name()   # inherited method
c.study()       # child method
```
Here, Student inherits the `name` attribute and `show_name` method from Person. The `student` class can directly use `self`.name even though it was defined in the parent class.

Inheritance of attributes and methods exists because many classes share common data and behavior. It **reduces duplicate code and makes programs easier to maintain and scale**.

## Method Overriding (Changing Parent Behavior)

Method overriding happens when a child class **changes the behavior of a method** that it inherited from the parent class. This is useful when the child class needs to **act differently**, even though it is still related to the parent.

The idea exists because **child classes are more specific**. A general parent class method may not **perfectly fit** the child’s behavior, so the child can redefine it.

Example:
``` python
class animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animal makes sound")

class dog(animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Wooff!!!")
```

Using the classes

``` python
a = animal()
d = dog()

a.sound()   # Animal makes sound
d.sound()   # Wooff!!!
```

Here, the `dog` class overrides the sound method of `animal`. Python uses the child’s method instead of the parent’s method when you call it on a Dog object.

Method overriding is important because it allows **polymorphism**, where different objects respond differently to the same method call.

## The `super()` Function and Why It Matters

The `super()` function is used to **call methods or constructors from the parent class inside the child class**. It is useful when you want to extend the parent’s behavior instead of completely replacing it.

For example, you may want the child class to use the parent’s constructor and then add extra features.

Example:
``` python 
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no):
        super().__init__(name)   # call parent constructor
        self.roll_no = roll_no
```

Using the class

``` python
s = student("Rohit", 21)
print(s.name)       # from Persion
print(s.roll_no)    # from Student
```
Here, `super().__init__(name)` calls the parent’s constructor so the `name` attribute is set correctly. Then the Student class adds its own data.

The `super()` function exists because it **prevents code duplication** and ensures the parent class is **initialized properly**, especially in complex inheritance structures.

## Types of inheritance in Python

Python supports **different types of inheritance to model real-world relationships** between classes. These types exist because not all relationships are simple one-to-one; sometimes classes share features in **chains** or from **multiple sources**.

**Single Inheritance** is the simplest form, where **one child class inherits from one parent class**. This is useful when there is a clear “is-a” relationship, like a Dog being an Animal.

``` python
class Animal:
    def eat(self):
        print("Animal eats")

class Dog(Animal):
    pass
```

**Multiple Inheritance** happens when a **child class inherits from more than one parent class**. This is useful when a class needs features from different sources, like a smartphone being both a phone and a camera.

``` python
class Phone:
    def call(self):
        print("Calling...")

class Camera:
    def click(self):
        print("Photo clicked")

class Smartphone(Phone, Camera):
    pass
```

![Multiple Inheritance](/python-from-zero/res/Multiple-Inheritance.png)

**Multilevel Inheritance** is when a class **inherits from a child class, forming a chain**. This models hierarchical relationships, like Animal → Mammal → Dog.

``` python
class Animal:
    pass

class Mammal(Animal):
    pass

class Dog(Mammal):
    pass
```
![Multi-Level Inheritance](/python-from-zero/res/Multi-level_Inheritance.png)

**Hierarchical Inheritance** is when **multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class**. This is useful when many classes share common behavior, like Dog and Cat both being Animals.

``` python
class Animal:
    pass

class Dog(Animal):
    pass

class Cat(Animal):
    pass
```

These inheritance types exist to model **complex real-world systems in a clean and organized way**. Python is flexible and even allows multiple inheritance, which some languages restrict.
