# Pseudo - Code
Pseudocode is a simple way of step - by - step writing program logic using plain language (`English`). It is not written in any specific programming language and cannot be executed by a computer. Pseudocode is meant only for humans to understand how a program should work.

It focuses on what the program should do, not on how it should be written in a particular language. Because of this, pseudocode is easy to read, even for beginners.

Pseudocode is the intermediate state between an idea and its implementation(`code`) in a high-level language.

**Example:**

``` text
START
INPUT name
PRINT "Hello" + name
END
```
This pseudocode explains the logic of greeting a user, without using real programming syntax.

``` python
name = input("Enter your name here: ")
print(f"Hello {name}")
```
