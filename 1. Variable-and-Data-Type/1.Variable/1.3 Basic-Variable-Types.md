# Basic Variable Types
Python has several basic variable data types that we will focus on.

## Strings
[Strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq) in Python are simply text—like words or sentences—wrapped in quotes: 'hello' or "hello".

``` python
single_quotes = 'Github Repo'
double_quotes = "Github Repo" 
```
> Pro Tip: Double quotation `" "` are preferred over single quotation `' '`.

## Numbers
Numbers are not surrounded by quotes when they're declared.

An [integer](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html) (or "int") is a number without a decimal part:

``` python
x = 3 # positive integer
y = -3 # negative integer
```

A [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) is a number with a decimal part:

``` python
x = 3.5 # positive floating point number
y = -3.5 # negative floating point number
```

## Booleans

A "[Boolean](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/bool.html#boolean-objects)" (or "bool") is a type that can only have one of two values: `True` or `False`. As you may have heard, computers really only use 1's and 0's. These 1's and 0's are just True/False boolean values.

``` python
is_short = True
is_tall = False
```

## Example Program
Write a program to print if a student have phone with him or not:
``` python
student_name = "Jatin"
have_phone = True
print(f"Does {student_name} have his phone with him at school? {have_phone}") # Output: Does Jatin have his phone with him at school? True
```
