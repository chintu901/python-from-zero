# Built-in Functions

Built-in functions are **predefined functions provided by Python** itself. This means they are available to use immediately, without importing any module or writing extra code. These functions handle common tasks such as displaying output, taking input, performing calculations, and checking data types.

Instead of writing complex logic from scratch, Python allows programmers to use built-in functions to perform frequent operations quickly and safely. This makes programs **shorter**, **clearer**, and **less error-prone**, especially for beginners.

For example:

``` python
print("Hello, World")
```

Here, `print()` is a built-in function that displays text on the screen.

Built-in functions represent **tested and optimized solutions** for common programming needs. Python’s creators designed these functions to be reliable, fast, and easy to use, which is why they are widely used in real-world programs.

For example, counting items in a list:

``` python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
count = 0

for item in fruits:
    count += 1

print(count)    # 3
```
Instead of manually counting items in a list, you can simply use:

``` python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
print(len(fruits))  # 3
```

## Commonly Used Built-in Functions

Python provides a wide range of built-in functions that cover **everyday programming needs**. As a beginner, you don’t need to memorize all of them at once. Instead, it’s important to understand what types of problems they solve and when to use them.

Below are the commonly used built-in functions, grouped by purpose.

### Input and Output Functions

These functions help a program **communicate with the user**.

| Functions | Description | Example |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `input()` | Takes input from the user | `name = input("Enter your name: ")` |
| `print()` | Displays output on the screen | `print("Hello")` |

Example:

``` python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello {name}")
```

### Type-Related and Conversion Functions

These functions help check or change data types.

| Functions | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `int()` | Converts to integer | `int(variable_name)` |
| `float()` | Converts to decimal | `float(variable_name)` |
| `str()` | Converts to string | `str(variable_name)` |
| `bool()` | Converts to Boolean | `bool(variable_name)` |

Example:

``` python
num = input("Enter number: ")   # By default input() store only string value

print(type(num))            # String type
print(type(int(num)))       # Integer type
print(type(float(num)))     # floating point type
print(type(bool(num)))      # boolean type
```

### Mathematical and Utility Functions

These functions perform **calculations or general-purpose tasks**.

| Functions | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `abs()` | Returns the absolute value of a number | `x = abs(-25.7)` |
| `round()` |  Round a number to a specified number of decimal places | `x = round(3.3333, 2)` |
| `pow()` | Calculate the power of a number | `x = pow(2,3)` |

Example:

``` python
num = input("Enter number: ")   # User enter: -22.9762

# Using the abs()
num = abs(float(num))
print(num)

# Using the round()
num = round(num, 2)
print(num)

# Using the pow()
num = pow(int(num), 2)
print(num)
```

Output:

``` bash
22.9762
22.98
484
```

### Collection-Related Functions

These functions work with lists, tuples, and other collections.

| Functions | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `len()` | Returns the number of items in an object | `len(list_name)` |
| `sum()` | Add all the elements of an iterable and return the total | `sum(list_name)` |
| `max()` | Find the largest (maximum) value among given arguments or within an iterable | `max(tuple_name)` |
| `min()` | Returns the smallest value from a set of values or the smallest item in an iterable | `min(tuple_name)` |

Example:

``` python
numbers = [2, 3, 1, 5]

print(len(numbers))
print(sum(numbers, 20))     # add numbers list + 20 
print(max(numbers))
print(min(numbers))
```

Output:

``` bash
4
31
5
1
```

### Checking and Comparison

Python provides built-in functions that help inspect values, verify data types, and perform safe checks.

| Functions | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `type()` | The `type()` function returns the data type of a value or variable | `print(type(x))` |
| `isinstance()` | The `isinstance()` function checks whether a value belongs to a specific data type and returns a Boolean result (`True` or `False`). | `print(isinstance(x, int))` |

``` python
num = 25

print(type(num))            # <class 'int'>
print((isinstance(x, int))) # True
```

## Using Built-in Functions Effectively

Built-in functions are most powerful when they are **used thoughtfully and combined correctly**. Writing effective Python code is not about using many functions, but about using the right functions at the right time.

When used well, built-in functions make code:
- Shorter and cleaner
- Easier to read and understand
- Less prone to logical errors

**Combining Built-in Functions:**

Built-in functions can be nested or combined to solve problems efficiently.

``` python
numbers = [10, 5, 20, 15]
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print(round(average, 2))
```
Here, multiple built-in functions work together to produce a clear and concise solution.

## Limitations of Built-in Functions

While built-in functions are powerful, they do not **solve every problem**. Understanding their limitations is just as important as knowing how to use them.

Built-in functions may fall short when:
- The logic is specific to your application
- Multiple steps must follow custom rules
- Behavior needs to be fine-tuned or extended

> [!NOTE]
> Built-in functions handle common tasks efficiently, but custom functions are essential when problems require specialized or flexible logic.
