# First Program
This page will guide you through the step-by-step process of creating your first Python program, from creating a Python file to executing the program.

## Setup & Requirements
Before writing your first Python program, make sure you have the following tools ready. Don’t worry — everything is simple and free.

### ✅Python installed
You need Python on your computer to run **.py** files.
- Download it from the official website. [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Make sure to check “Add Python to PATH” during installation (Windows)
To confirm the installation, open your terminal and run:
```bash
python --version
```
You should see something like:
```bash
python 3.x.x
```

### ✅A Code Editor
You can write Python in any text editor, but using a code editor makes the experience smoother.

**Recommended:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

- Free
- Easy to use
- Has Python extension for better coding experience\


- If you want to run the program online, visit this [website](https://pythononline.io/python-compiler.html) (not recommended).
