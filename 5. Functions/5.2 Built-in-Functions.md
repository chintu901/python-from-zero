# Built-in Functions

Built-in functions are **predefined functions provided by Python** itself. This means they are available to use immediately, without importing any module or writing extra code. These functions handle common tasks such as displaying output, taking input, performing calculations, and checking data types.

Instead of writing complex logic from scratch, Python allows programmers to use built-in functions to perform frequent operations quickly and safely. This makes programs **shorter**, **clearer**, and **less error-prone**, especially for beginners.

For example:

``` python
print("Hello, World")
```

Here, `print()` is a built-in function that displays text on the screen.

Built-in functions represent **tested and optimized solutions** for common programming needs. Python’s creators designed these functions to be reliable, fast, and easy to use, which is why they are widely used in real-world programs.

For example, counting items in a list:

``` python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
count = 0

for item in fruits:
    count += 1

print(count)    # 3
```
Instead of manually counting items in a list, you can simply use:

``` python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
print(len(fruits))  # 3
```

## Commonly Used Built-in Functions

Python provides a wide range of built-in functions that cover **everyday programming needs**. As a beginner, you don’t need to memorize all of them at once. Instead, it’s important to understand what types of problems they solve and when to use them.

Below are the commonly used built-in functions, grouped by purpose.
