# `while` loop

A `while` loop is used to **repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains true**. Instead of iterating over a fixed sequence, the loop depends entirely on a **logical condition**.

In simple terms, a while loop says:
“Keep doing this while a certain condition is true.”

Example:

``` python
num = 1

while num < 3:
    print(num)
    num += 1
```

Here, the loop continues running until the condition num < 3 becomes `False`.

**Why **

The `while` loop exists because not all problems fit a fixed number of iterations. In many real-world cases, a program must **keep running until something changes**.

The while loop helps by:
- Responding to user input
- Waiting for a condition to be satisfied
- Handling ongoing processes

For example, programs often need to:
- Keep asking for valid input
- Run until a user chooses to exit
- Monitor changing values

Using a for loop in these cases would be unclear or impractical.

## Basic Syntax of the `while` Loop

The `while` loop has a simple structure that focuses on a **condition**.
As long as this condition evaluates to `True`, the loop continues to run.

**General Syntax:**

``` python
while condition:
    # code to repeat
```

- `condition`: A Boolean expression (`True` or `False`) that controls the loop.

- **Colon (`:`)**: Indicates the start of the loop body.

- **Indentation**: All statements inside the loop must be indented. Python uses indentation to define the loop block.

**Example:**

``` python
number = 1

while number <= 3:
    print(number)
    number += 1
```

**How this works:**
- The condition is checked before each iteration
- The loop prints the number
- The value of number changes
- The loop stops when the condition becomes `False`

**Important Syntax Rules:**
- If the condition is `False` at the start, the loop never runs
- Incorrect indentation will break the loop logic
- The loop body must influence the condition at some point

## Updating the Loop Condition

Updating the loop condition is essential in a `while` loop. Without updates, the condition may never change, leading to an infinite loop.

**Why Condition Updates Are Necessary**
- A while loop continues based on its condition. To stop the loop:
- Variables involved in the condition must change
- The condition must eventually become False

**Common Update Patterns**
- Incrementing a counter
- Decrementing a value
- Updating a variable based on input

**Example:**

``` python
count = 5

while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
```
> [!NOTE]
> Updating the loop condition is critical in `while` loops to ensure the loop eventually stops and behaves correctly.

## Using break and continue in while Loops

Just like `for` loops, `while` loops support **loop control statements** that allow you to change the normal flow of execution. These statements help you stop a loop early or skip specific iterations based on conditions.

### Using `break` to Exit a `while` Loop

The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop, even if the loop condition is still `True`.

**Example:**

``` python
number = 1

while True:
    if number == 4:
        break
    print(number)
    number += 1
```

Here, the loop stops as soon as `number` reaches `4`.

### Using `continue` to Skip an Iteration

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves back to checking the loop condition.

Example:

``` python
number = 0

while number < 5:
    number += 1
    if number == 3:
        continue
    print(number)
```

In this case, `3` is skipped

> [!NOTE]
> `break` and `continue` give precise control over `while` loops, allowing early exits and skipped iterations without complicating loop conditions.

## Infinite `while` Loops (Intentional vs Accidental)

An infinite `while` loop is a loop that **never stops running on its own**. This happens when the loop condition never becomes `False`.

At a beginner level, infinite loops are usually accidental, but in professional programs, they can also be intentional and useful.

**Accidental Infinite Loops:**

``` python
count = 1

while count > 0:
    print(count)
```
Since `count` never changes, the loop never ends.

**Intentional Infinite Loops:**

``` python
while True:
    user_input = input("Type 'exit' to quit: ")
    if user_input == "exit":
        break
```
Here, `break` provides a controlled exit.


> [!NOTE]
> Infinite `while` loops occur when conditions never change, so intentional use requires clear exit logic to avoid freezing programs.

## Nested `while` Loops

Nested `while` loops are `while` loops placed **inside another** `while` **loop**. The inner loop runs completely for each iteration of the outer loop.

**How Nested while Loops Work**

Execution flow:
- Outer loop starts
- Inner loop runs until its condition becomes `False`
- Outer loop continues to the next iteration

``` python
row = 1

while row <= 3:
    col = 1
    while col <= 3:
        print(f"Row {row}, Column {col}")
        col += 1
    row += 1
```
