# Boolean Data Type

A Boolean is a data type that represents only two possible values:

- `True`
- `False`

These values are used to represent conditions, decisions, or states in a program.
In simple words, a Boolean helps a program answer yes or no, on or off, or true or false type questions.

For example:

- Is the user logged in? → `True` or `False`
- Is the password correct? → `True` or `False` 
- Is the number greater than 10? → `True` or `False`

``` python
users = {"alex", "bob", "max"}
user_name = input("Please provide you user name: ")

# Check if the user already logged in
isloggedin = user_name.lower() in users

if isloggedin:
    print("You already have account")
else:
    print("Please register first, before logging in")
```

**Boolean is a Built-in Data Type:**

Python has a built-in Boolean data type called `bool`.

You can check the type of a Boolean value using `type()`:

``` python
x = True
print(type(x))
```

Output:

``` bash
<class 'bool'>
```

> [!NOTE]
> In Python, Boolean values are written as `True` and `False`, belong to the built-in `bool` data type, and must always use the correct capitalization.

## Comparison Operators and Boolean Results

Comparison operators are used to **compare two values**.
The result of every comparison in Python is always a **Boolean value**: `True` or `False`.

These operators exist because programs constantly need to check conditions before making decisions.

**Common Comparison Operators**

| Operators | Meaning | Example |
|-------|-----|----------|
| `==` | Equal to | `5 == 5` |
| `!=` | Not Equal to | `4 != 5` |
| `>` | Greater than | `10 > 5` |
| `<` | Less than | `2 < 4` |
| `>=` | Greater than or Equal to | `5 >= 5` |
| `<=` | Less than or Equal to | `4 <= 5` |

**Example Program:**

``` python
a = 100
b = 50

print(a == b)   # False
print(a != b)   # True
print(a > b)    # True
print(a < b)    # False
print(a >= b)   # Ture
print(a <= b)   # False
```

**Why Comparison Return Boolean Values?**

Comparisons answer yes/no questions:

- Is one value larger than another?
- Are two values equal?

Since the answer can only be True or False, Python uses the Boolean data type to represent the result.

This design keeps decision-making **simple**, **readable**, and **efficient**.

> [!NOTE]
> Comparison operators evaluate conditions and always return a Boolean value, which allows Python to make decisions based on data.

## Logical Operators with Boolean Values

Logical operators are used to **combine** or **modify** Boolean expressions.
They allow programs to handle **multiple conditions** at the same time.

**Common Logical Operators**

| Logical Operators | Meaning | Example |
|-------|-----|----------|
| `and` | The `and` operator returns `True` only if all conditions are `True`. | `print(age >= 18 and has_id)` |
| `or` | The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`. | `print(is_admin or is_editor)` |
| `not` | The `not` operator reverses a Boolean value. | `print(not is_logged_in)` |

**Example Program:**

``` python
is_admin = True
is_editor = False

print(is_admin and is_editor)   # False
print(is_admin or is_editor)    # True 
print(not is_editor)            # True
```

**Why Logical Operators Exist?**

Real programs rarely depend on a single condition.
Logical operators allow Python to:

- Combine multiple checks
- Write clear decision logic
- Avoid deeply nested conditions

They are essential for building readable and maintainable code.

> [!NOTE]
> Logical operators (and, or, not) allow multiple Boolean conditions to be combined or reversed, making complex decision-making possible in Python.
