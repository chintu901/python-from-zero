# Classes and Objects

**Classes:** A class in Python is a **blueprint or template** that defines how something should **look** and **behave**. It describes what data an object will store and what actions it can perform. You can think of a class as a design plan, not the real thing. For example, a “Student” class describes what every student object should have, such as a name and age, and what it can do, such as display details.

``` python
class student:
    pass
```

**Objects:** An object is a **real instance created from a class**. When you create an object, Python allocates memory for it and stores its own data. If a class is a blueprint of a house, then an object is an actual house built using that blueprint. You can create many objects from the same class, and each object can have different data.

``` python
class Student:
    pass

s1 = Student()   # object 1
s2 = Student()   # object 2
```

The difference between a class and an object is simple: a class is just a design, while an object is the real thing created from that design. One class can produce unlimited objects, and all those objects follow the same structure defined by the class.

## Attributes (Variables Inside a Class)

Attributes are **variables that belong to a class or an object**.
They store data related to the object.

For example, a Student object can have attributes like:
- name
- age
- marks

In Python, attributes are usually created inside the class using `self`.

``` python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age, marks):
        self.name = name    # attribute
        self.age =  age     # attribute
        self.marks = marks  # attribute
s1 = Student("Mohit", 21, 95)
s2 = Student("Chetan", 24, 85)
s3 = Student("Keshav", 24, 92)

print(s1.name)  # Mohit
print(s2.age)   # 24
```
Here:
- self.name and self.age are instance attributes
- Each object can have different values
