# Advanced Testing Concepts

## Test Coverage

Writing tests is important — but how do you know if you tested enough?

Test coverage measures how much of your code is **executed while running tests**. It helps **identify untested** parts of your program.

For example, if a function has multiple conditions and your tests only cover one case, other branches may contain hidden bugs.

High test coverage means:
- Most functions are tested
- Edge cases are considered
- Critical logic paths are verified

However, coverage alone does not guarantee quality. You can have 100% coverage with poor tests. The goal is meaningful coverage, not just high numbers.

### Important Points About Coverage
- Aim to test critical logic first
- Cover both success and failure cases
- Test edge conditions (empty inputs, negative values, large data)
- Do not focus only on percentage — focus on correctness
