# Basic Operations

In programming, an operation is an action performed on data to produce a result.
Data by itself does nothing—**operations are what make programs useful**.

For example:

- Adding two numbers

- Comparing values

- Updating a variable

- Checking a condition

All of these are operations.

Think of **data** as raw information and **operations** as the tools that work on it.

``` python
a = 10
b = 5
result = a + b  # 15
```

**Operations Enable Program Logic:**

Logic in a program is created by combining operations.

``` python
xample:

score = 75

passed = score >= 40
```

The comparison operation (`>=`) converts raw data into a meaningful outcome (`True` or `False`), which can then control program behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> Operations are actions that work on data to create results, making programs dynamic, logical, and capable of solving real problems.

## Types of Operations

There are five types of operations in python:

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Arithmetic operations are used to perform mathematical calculations such as **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.

- **Assignment Operations:** Assignment operations are used to **store values in variables** and **update existing values**.

- **Comparison Operations:** Comparison operations are used to **compare two values**.

- **Logical Operations:** Logical operations are used to **combine** or **modify Boolean values**.

- **Bitwise Operations:** Bitwise operations work on the **binary representation (bits)** of numbers instead of their actual values.
