# Pseudo - Code
Pseudocode is a simple way of step - by - step writing program logic using plain language (`English`). It is not written in any specific programming language and cannot be executed by a computer. Pseudocode is meant only for humans to understand how a program should work.

It focuses on what the program should do, not on how it should be written in a particular language. Because of this, pseudocode is easy to read, even for beginners.

Pseudocode is the intermediate state between an idea and its implementation(`code`) in a high-level language.

**Example:**

``` text
START
INPUT name
PRINT "Hello" + name
END
```
> Note: This pseudocode explains the logic of greeting a user, without using real programming syntax.

``` python
# Program of the pseudocode
name = input("Enter your name here: ")
print(f"Hello {name}")
```
## Why Use Pseudocode?

Pseudocode helps programmers plan and organize their thoughts before writing actual code. It allows you to think about the problem step by step without worrying about syntax errors.

**Benefits of Using Pseudocode**

- Helps in understanding the problem clearly

- Makes complex logic easier to break down

- Reduces mistakes while coding

- Saves time when writing real code

- Improves problem-solving skills

**Example Use Case**

Before writing a program, you can first write pseudocode like this:

``` text
START
ASK user for age
IF age >= 18
    PRINT "Eligible to vote"
ELSE 
    PRINT "Not eligible"
END
```

program:

``` python
age = int(input("What's your age? "))

if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
```

## How to write Pseudocode?

Before writing the pseudocode of any algorithm the following points must be kept in mind. 

- Organize the sequence of tasks and write the pseudocode accordingly.
- At first, establishes the main goal or the aim.  Example:

``` text 
This program will print first N numbers of Fibonacci series.
```

- Use standard programming structures such as `if-else`, `for`, `while`, and `cases` the way we use them in programming. Indent the statements `if-else`, `for`, `while` loops as they are indented in a program, it helps to comprehend the decision control and execution mechanism. It also improves readability to a great extent. Example:

``` python
IF "1"
   print response
       "I AM CASE 1"

IF "2"
   print response
       "I AM CASE 2"
```

- Use appropriate naming conventions. The human tendency follows the approach of following what we see. If a programmer goes through a pseudo code, his approach will be the same as per that, so the naming must be simple and distinct.

- Reserved commands or keywords must be represented in capital letters. Example: if you are writing IF…ELSE statements then make sure IF and ELSE be in capital letters.

- Check whether all the sections of a pseudo code are complete, finite, and clear to understand and comprehend. Also, explain everything that is going to happen in the actual code.

- Don't write the pseudocode in a programming language. It is necessary that the pseudocode is simple and easy to understand even for a layman or client, minimizing the use of technical terms.

## Basic Pseudocode Keywords

Pseudocode uses common keywords to represent actions and control flow. These keywords are not fixed rules but are widely used for clarity.

**Common Keywords**

- **START / END** – Marks the beginning and end of the program

- **INPUT** – Takes input from the user

- **OUTPUT / PRINT** – Displays output

- **SET / ASSIGN** – Stores a value in a variable

- **IF / ELSE** – Makes decisions

- **WHILE / FOR** – Repeats actions

**Example:**
``` text
START
INPUT number
FOR i = 1 TO number
    PRINT "Hello"
END FOR
END
```
