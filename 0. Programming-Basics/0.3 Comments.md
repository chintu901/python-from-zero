# Comments

Comments are notes written inside a program to help humans understand the code. They are not executed by the computer, which means they do not affect how the program runs. A compiler or interpreter completely ignores comments.

Comments are mainly used to explain what the code is doing or why it is written in a certain way. They make programs easier to read, understand, and maintain—especially when the code becomes long or complex.

**Example (Python)**
``` python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a message on the screen
```

In the example above:

- The line starting with `#` is a comment.

- The comment explains what the code does.

- The computer only runs the `print()` statement.

## Why Comments are Importent

Comments are important in programming for several reasons:
- _**Clarification:**_ They help explain complex code or provide context for new readers.
- _**Maintainability:**_ Comments can be updated to reflect changes in the code or the code's purpose.
- _**Debugging:**_ They can be used to temporarily disable parts of the code for testing or debugging purposes.
- _**Collaboration:**_ Comments can help team members understand each other's code and its purpose.

However, it's also important to use comments wisely to avoid cluttering the codebase and to ensure that they are up-to-date and relevant to the code's current state. 

## Types of Comments

Different programming languages support different types of comments, but the idea behind all of them is the same—to explain code for humans. Below are the most commonly used types of comments.

### -> _Single - Line Comments:_

Single-line comments are used to write short explanations on one line. They are often placed above a line of code or at the end of a line.

**Example (Python)**
``` python
# This variable stores the user's age
age = 20
print(age)  # Display the age
```

Use single-line comments when:

- Explaining a small piece of code

- Adding short notes or reminders

### -> _Multi - Line Comments / Block Comments:_

Multi-line comments are used to write explanations that span multiple lines. They are helpful when describing logic, steps, or sections of code.

**Example (Python – using multiple `#`)**
``` python
# This program takes user input
# and prints a greeting message
# based on the name provided

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

### -> _Documentation Comments (Docstrings):_

Documentation comments are special comments used to describe what a function, class, or module does. In Python, these are written using triple quotes and are called docstrings.

**Example (Python)**

``` python
def greet(name):
    """
    This function takes a name
    and prints a greeting message.
    """
    print("Hello", name)
```

Documentation comments are useful for:

- Creating official documentation

- Helping other developers understand your code

- Large and professional projects

## Commenting Practices

While there are many resources to help programmers write better code—such as books and static analyzers—there are few for writing better comments. While it's easy to measure the quantity of comments in a program, it's hard to measure the quality, and the two are not necessarily correlated. A bad comment is worse than no comment at all. Here are some dos and don'ts for writing better comments.

### -> _Good Commenting Practices:_

Good comments make your code easy to read and understand. A good programmer knows when and how to write comments properly.

**Best Practices to Follow**

- Write comments that clearly explain the purpose of the code.

- Explain why something is done, not just what is done.

- Keep comments short and meaningful.

- Write comments in simple language.

- Update comments when you change the code.

Example:
``` python
# Calculate total price after applying discount
total_price = price - discount
```

✔️ This comment explains why the calculation is done.

### -> _Bad Commenting Practices:_

Bad comments can make code confusing or misleading. Avoid these common mistakes.

**What to Avoid**

- Writing comments for obvious code.

- Over-commenting every single line.

- Leaving old or incorrect comments.

- Using comments instead of clear variable names.

Bad Example:
``` python
# Add 1 to x
x = x + 1
```

❌ The comment adds no useful information.

Better Example:
``` python
# Increase retry count after failed login attempt
retry_count += 1
```

**Key Difference**

- Good comments help understanding.

- Bad comments reduce code quality.

A good programmer writes comments that add value, not noise.

## Comments for Beginners

Comments are especially helpful when you are new to programming. They help you think clearly and understand what your code is doing.

**How Beginners Can Use Comments**

- Use comments to plan your logic before writing code.

- Break a problem into steps using comments.

- Explain your own code in simple words.

- Temporarily disable code while testing.

Example:
``` python
# Step 1: Ask the user for their name
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Step 2: Check if the name is empty
if name == "":
    print("Name not provided")

# Step 3: Greet the user
else:
    print("Hello", name)
```
Using comments like this helps beginners build confidence and reduce mistakes.

## Best Practices Summary

Comments should make your code clear, helpful, and easy to understand. Writing good comments is an important skill for every programmer.

**Key Points to Remember**

- Write comments to explain why the code exists.

- Avoid commenting on code that is already clear.

- Keep comments simple, short, and meaningful.

- Use comments to explain complex logic.

- Always update comments when you update the code.

- Prefer clear variable and function names over extra comments.

- Use `TODO` and `FIXME` comments wisely.

**Golden Rule**
> Good code explains itself, comments explain the reasoning.

**Final Tip**

Think of comments as a way to communicate with other programmers and your future self. If a comment does not add value, it is better not to write it.

Writing good comments helps you become a better and more professional programmer.
