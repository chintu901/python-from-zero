# Variable Basic
A variable in Python is like a label you stick on a box so you can refer to what's inside later. In Python, you would do that by writing:
``` python
age = 25 # age is the variable name and 25 is the value (data)
```
> Note:I named the variable "age," but you can choose any name you like.

When you write this, python creates a box(variable) with name 
`age` and stores 25 in that box(variable).

- This process of creating a variable to store a value is called **Declaration** and
- The process of setting its value for the first time is called **Initialization**.

In Python, a variable:
- Points to a value in memory.
- Can be updated any time.
- Doesn't need a fixed typen (Python is dynamically typed, which means you do not need to specify the data type; it can decide on its own.)
