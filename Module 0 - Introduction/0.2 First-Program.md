# First Program
This page will guide you through the step-by-step process of creating your first Python program, from creating a Python file to executing the program.

## Setup & Requirements
Before writing your first Python program, make sure you have the following tools ready. Don’t worry — everything is simple and free.

### ✅Python installed
You need Python on your computer to run **.py** files.
- Download it from the official website. [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Make sure to check “Add Python to PATH” during installation (Windows)
To confirm the installation, open your terminal and run:
```bash
python --version
```
You should see something like:
```bash
python 3.x.x
```

### ✅A Code Editor
You can write Python in any text editor, but using a code editor makes the experience smoother.

**Recommended:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

- Free
- Easy to use
- Has Python extension for better coding experience\


- If you want to run the program online, visit this [website](https://pythononline.io/python-compiler.html) (not recommended).

## Creating Your First Python File (Using the Terminal)
To write and run your first Python program, you’ll start by creating a folder and a Python file. We will do everything through the terminal so you understand how real developers work.

Follow the steps bellow.

### Step 1: Open the terminal in the Vscode editor.
To open the terminal in Visual Studio Code, follow the steps below:

- Click on the "Terminal" button from the top menu.

- Then click on the "New Terminal" button.
- You will see the terminal appear at the bottom of the window, where you can enter your commands.

### Step 2: Create a project folder 
Type the following command to create new folder:
``` bash
mkdir first-python-program
```
Now, go inside the folder:
``` bash
cd first-python-program
```
Your terminal is now inside a clean project directory.

### Step 3: Create new python file
We'll create a file where we will write code.

Type the following command to create new file:
``` bash
code hello-world.py
```
