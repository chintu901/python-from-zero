# Advanced List Comprehensions Concepts

## List Comprehensions with Functions

List comprehensions become even more powerful when combined with functions. Instead of writing long transformation logic inside the comprehension, you can call **built-in** or **custom functions** to keep the code clean and readable.

This improves:
- Code clarity
- Reusability
- Maintainability

**Using Built-in Functions**

You can directly use Python’s **built-in functions** inside list comprehensions.

**Example: Using abs()**

``` python 
numbers = [-3, -1, 0, 2, 4]
absolute_values = [abs(num) for num in numbers] # [3, 1, 0, 2, 4]
```

**Using String Methods**

``` python 
names = ["alice", "BOB", "charlie"]
formatted = [name.capitalize() for name in names]   # ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

```

**Using Custom Functions**

You can define your own function and call it inside a list comprehension.

Example:-
``` python
def square(x):
    return x * x

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = [square(num) for num in numbers]  # [1, 4, 9, 16]
```


Example with Condition + Function:-

``` python
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = range(1, 11)
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if is_even(num)]
```

## List Comprehensions with Multiple Iterables

List comprehensions can include multiple `for` **clauses**, allowing you to work with more than one iterable.

This is similar to writing nested loops.

**Basic Syntax with Multiple Iterables**
``` python 
[expression for item1 in iterable1 for item2 in iterable2]
```

**This behaves like:**

``` python
for item1 in iterable1:
    for item2 in iterable2:
        ...
```

**Example:**
``` python
colors = ["red", "blue"]
sizes = ["S", "M"]

combinations = [(color, size) for color in colors for size in sizes]
```

Result:

``` python
[('red', 'S'), ('red', 'M'), ('blue', 'S'), ('blue', 'M')]
```

### Important Behaviour

The order of `for` clauses matters.

``` python
[(x, y) for x in A for y in B]
```
means:
- Loop through A first
- For each element of A, loop through B
