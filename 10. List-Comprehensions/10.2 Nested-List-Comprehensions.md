# Nested List Comprehensions

Nested list comprehensions are used when working with **nested loops** or **multi-level data structures**. They allow you to **flatten**, **transform**, or **generate complex lists** using a compact syntax.

A nested list comprehension is essentially a list comprehension **inside another loop**, similar to nested for loops in traditional Python code.

**General Syntax:**

``` python
[expression for item1 in iterable1 for item2 in iterable2]
```

This is equivalent to:

``` python
result = []
for item1 in iterable1:
    for item2 in iterable2:
        result.append(expression)
```

Example: Creating Pairs

``` python
pairs = [(x, y) for x in [1, 2] for y in [3, 4]]
```

Result:

``` bash
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
```
