# Data Types Basic

Data types define **what kind of value a variable can store** in a program. They tell Python how to **store the data in memory** and what **operations can be performed** on that data.

In simple words, a data type describes the **type of information** a variable holds, such as numbers, text, or collections of values.

Data types are important in python becouse:

- They help Python understand how to process data.

- They decide what operations are allowed on a value.

- They help prevent logical errors in programs.

- They make code easier to read and understand.

``` python
x = 2       # Int data type
y = 2.5     # Float data type
z = "Two"   # String data type
```

**Dynamic Data Typing in Python**

Python is an dynamically typed langauge, which means you do not need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. Python automatically decides the data type based on the value assigned.

``` python
x = 10  # Int data type
print(type(x))  # Output: Integer

x = "Ten"   # String data type
print(type(x))  # Output: String 
```
Here, the same variable `x` first stores an integer and later stores a string.

## Built-in Data Types in Python

Python provides several **built-in data types** that are used to store different kinds of data. These data types are already available in Python, so you do not need to define them yourself.

Each data type is designed for a **specific purpose**, such as storing numbers, text, or collections of values.

1. Numeric Types: [int](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-int-function/), [float](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-float-type-and-its-methods/), [complex](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-complex-function/)

2. Text Type: [String](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-string/)

3. Sequence Types: [list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-lists/), [tuple](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-tuples/)

4. Mapping Type: [dict](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-dictionary/)

5. Boolean type: [bool](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/boolean-data-type-in-python/)

6. Set Types: [set](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-sets/), [frozenset](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/frozenset-in-python/)

## Setting the Data Type :shipit:

In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:


| Example | Data Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| x = 1  | `int`  |
| x = 5.6  | `float`  |
| x = "Hello World"  | `str`  |
| x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  | `list`  |

### _Setting the Specific Data Type:_

If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:

| Example | Data Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| x = int(1)  | `int`  |
| x = float(5.6)  | `float`  |
| x = str("Hello World")  | `str`  |
| x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  | `list`  |

## Checking Data Types

In Python, you can check the data type of a variable to understand **what kind of value it stores**. This is useful for debugging, validation, and writing safe programs.

Python mainly provides two ways to check data types: `type()` and `isinstance()`.

### 1. Using `type()`:

The `type()` function returns the exact data type of a value.

Example:

``` python
a = 1
b = 2.5
c = "Python"

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
```

Output:

``` bash
<class `int`>
<class `float`>
<class `str`>
```
Use `type()` when you want to know the **exact type** of a variable.

### 2. Using `isinstance()`

The `isinstance()` function checks whether a value belongs to a specific data type. It returns `True` or `False`.

Example:
``` python
x = 10

print(isinstance(x, int))
print(isinstance(x, float))
```

Output:

``` bash
True
False
```

you can also check against multiple types

``` python
x = 10

print(isinstance(x, (int, float)))
```

> ![Note]
> Prefer `isinstance()` for type checking, especially in real programs.
