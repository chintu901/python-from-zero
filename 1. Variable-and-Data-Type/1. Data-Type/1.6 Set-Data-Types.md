# Set Data Types

Set data types in Python are used to **store multiple unique values** in a single variable.
Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not allow **duplicate elements** and do not follow any **specific order**.

**Sets are especially useful when you want to:**
- Remove duplicate values.
- Perform mathematical operations like union and intersection.
- Check membership efficiently.

``` python
numbers = {1,2,3,4,5}
print(numbers)
```

## Characteristics of Sets

Sets have some **important characteristics** that make them different from other data types.

**Unordered Collection:**

- Elements do not have a fixed order.
- Indexing and slicing are not supported.

``` python
numbers = {1,2,3,4}
print(number[0])    # TypeError
```

**Unique Elements Only:**

Duplicate values are **automatically removed**.

``` python
numbers = {1,1,2,3,3}
print(numbers)  # {1,2,3}
```
**No Indexing or Slicing:**

You cannot access elements using index positions.

**Mutability:**

- `set` is mutable (can be modified).
- `frozenset` is immutable (cannot be modified).

> Sets are ideal for uniqueness and mathematical operations, not ordered data storage.

## Types of Set Data Types

Python provides **two types of set data types**:

**Set (`set`):**

- Mutable (elements can be added or removed)
- Unordered
- Does not allow duplicate values

``` python
numbers = {1, 2, 3}
numbers[1] = 5
print(numbers)
```

**Frozen Set (frozenset):**

- Immutable (cannot be changed after creation)
- Unordered
- Does not allow duplicate values

``` python
numbers = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

**Comparison Summary**

| Feature | Set | Frozenset |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Mutable | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Allows duplicates | ❌ No  | ❌ No |
| Unordered | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

> [!NOTE]
> Use `set` when data needs to change, and `frozenset` when data should remain fixed.
