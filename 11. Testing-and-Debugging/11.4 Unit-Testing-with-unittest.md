# Unit Testing with `unittest` (Structured Testing Framework)

## Intro to `unittest`

As programs grow larger, simple `assert` statements become difficult to manage. Professional software development requires a structured approach to testing, and Python provides this through its built-in testing framework called `unittest`.

`unittest` allows developers to **organize tests into classes**, **group related test cases together**, and **run all tests automatically**. Instead of manually checking outputs, you define expected behavior in test methods, and the framework verifies whether your code behaves correctly.

One of the major advantages of `unittest` is that it produces structured reports. It does not stop at the first failure like a normal `assert`. Instead, it **runs all tests** and provides a **summary of which tests passed and which failed**. This makes it suitable for real-world applications and team-based development.

### Why Use `unittest` Instead of `assert`?

Unlike simple `assert` statements:
- Tests do not stop at the first failure.
- You get structured output (pass/fail summary).
- Tests can be organized logically.
- You can reuse setup code.
- It supports automation in CI/CD pipelines.

unittest is suitable for professional development and production systems.

## Basic Structure of a `unittest` Program

A typical `unittest` file follows a clear structure. First, the `unittest` module is imported. Then, a test class is created that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. Inside this class, **individual test methods** are written. Finally, `unittest.main()` is called to execute the tests.

Here is a simple example:

``` python
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add_positive_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

    def test_add_negative_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, -1), -2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, two test cases verify different behaviors of the `add` function. When the file is executed, Python automatically runs all methods that begin with `test_`.

### Understanding the Components
Test Class

Every test class must inherit from `unittest.TestCase`. This inheritance gives access to powerful assertion methods such as `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, and `assertRaises`.

### Test Methods

Each test method should:
- Start with the prefix `test_`
- Check only one specific behavior
- Be independent of other tests

Keeping tests focused makes them easier to understand and maintain.
