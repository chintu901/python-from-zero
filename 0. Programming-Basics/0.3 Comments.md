# Comments
Comments are notes written inside a program to help humans understand the code. They are not executed by the computer, which means they do not affect how the program runs. A compiler or interpreter completely ignores comments.

Comments are mainly used to explain what the code is doing or why it is written in a certain way. They make programs easier to read, understand, and maintain—especially when the code becomes long or complex.

**Example (Python)**
``` python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a message on the screen
```

In the example above:

- The line starting with `#` is a comment.

- The comment explains what the code does.

- The computer only runs the `print()` statement.

## Why Comments are Importent
Comments are important in programming for several reasons:
- _**Clarification:**_ They help explain complex code or provide context for new readers.
- _**Maintainability:**_ Comments can be updated to reflect changes in the code or the code's purpose.
- _**Debugging:**_ They can be used to temporarily disable parts of the code for testing or debugging purposes.
- _**Collaboration:**_ Comments can help team members understand each other's code and its purpose.
However, it's also important to use comments wisely to avoid cluttering the codebase and to ensure that they are up-to-date and relevant to the code's current state.
