# `for` Loop

A `for` loop is used to **iterate over a sequence of values**, meaning it runs the same block of code once for each item in that sequence. Instead of repeating code manually, the loop automatically moves from one value to the next.

In Python, a for loop does not count numbers by default like in some other languages. Instead, it works by taking items one at a time from a sequence, such as:
- A `list`
- A `string`
- A `tuple`
- A `range` of numbers

Example:

``` python
word = "Python"

for letter in word:
    print(letter)
```

**Why the for Loop Exists?**

Here, the loop runs once for each character in the string.

The for loop exists because programs often need to process multiple values in the same way. Writing separate code for each value would be inefficient and difficult to maintain.

The for loop helps by:
- Eliminating duplicated code.
- Handling collections of any size.
- Making programs adaptable to changing data.

For example, whether a list has 3 items or 3,000 items, the same for loop works without modification.

## Basic Syntax of the `for` Loop

The `for` loop follows a **clear** and **readable structure** that tells Python how to **repeat a block of code** for each item in a sequence.

**General Syntax:**

``` python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to repeat
```
- `variable`: This is the loop variable. It temporarily stores the current item from the sequence during each iteration.

- `sequence`: This is the collection of values the loop will iterate over, such as a list, string, tuple, or range.

- **Colon (`:`)**: The colon indicates the start of the loop body.

- **Indentation**: All code inside the loop must be indented. Python uses indentation to decide what belongs to the loop.

**Example:**

``` python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "Audi"]

for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "Audi":
        print("Audi is car not fruit")
    else:
        print(fruit)
```

How this works:
- On the first iteration, `fruit` is `apple`.
- On the second iteration, `fruit` is `banana`.
- On the third iteration, `fruit` is `mango`.
- On the fourth iteration, `fruit` is `Audi` and program will print `Audi is car not fruit`.
- After the sequence ends, the loop stops automatically.

**Important Syntax Rules**
- The loop variable name can be anything meaningful.
- The loop body will not run if the sequence is empty.
- Incorrect indentation will cause errors or unexpected behavior.

## Using `range()` with for Loops

The `range()` function is commonly used with for loops to **repeat an action a specific number of times**. It generates a sequence of numbers that the loop can iterate over.

**What `range()` Does?**

`range()` creates a sequence of numbers:
- Starting from a value (optional)
- Ending before a value (required)
- Moving by a step value (optional)

Basic example:

``` python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
This loop runs **5 times**, printing numbers from 0 to 4.

### Common `range()` pattern

``` python
range(stop)          # starts from 0
range(start, stop)   # starts from start
range(start, stop, step)
```

**Example:**

``` python
for i in range(2, 10, 2):
    print(i, end = " ")     # 2 4 6 8
```

This prints even numbers between 2 and 8.

## Accessing Index and Value

In many situations, you only need the **value** from a sequence. However, sometimes you also need the **position (index)** of that value. Python provides simple ways to handle both cases inside a for loop.

### Accessing Only the Value

By default, a `for` loop gives you the value directly.

``` python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]

for color in colors:
    print(color)
```

This approach is preferred when the index is not required.

### Accessing Index and Value Together Using `enumerate()`

The `enumerate()` function allows you to get **both the index and the value** at the same time.

``` python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]

for index, color in enumerate(colors):
    print(index, color)
```

Output:

``` bash
0 red
1 blue
2 green
```

This avoids manual index tracking and makes code easier to read.

> [!NOTE]
> Use direct iteration for simplicity, and use `enumerate()` when both index and value are required.

## Nested `for` Loops

Nested `for` loops are loops placed **inside another** `for` **loop**. This means the inner loop runs completely for each iteration of the outer loop.

``` python
for row in range(1, 4):
    for col in range(1, 4):
        print(f"Row {row}, Column {col}")
```

> [!NOTE]
> Nested `for` loops handle multi-level repetition but should be used carefully to maintain readability and performance.
