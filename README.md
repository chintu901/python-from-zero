# python-from-zero
A beginner-friendly Python learning journey where I study new concepts and reinforce them through problem-solving. Each folder includes explanations, exercises, and simple solutions covering core Python topics like variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, and more.

## Python Learning Journey (Beginner-Friendly)

This repository documents my personal Python learning path.  
For every new concept I study, I practice it through problem-solving and upload both the questions and my solutions.

### What you'll find here:
- Beginner-friendly explanations of Python concepts
- Practice problems for each topic
- Clean and simple solutions
- Organized topic-wise folders (e.g., variables, loops, strings, functions)
- A growing collection of exercises as I learn more

### Topics Covered (so far):
- Variables & Data Types
- Conditionals (if/elif/else)
- Loops (for, while, break, continue, else)
- Strings
- And more as I continue learning...

Feel free to explore, learn, or practice along with me!
