# Comments
Comments are notes written inside a program to help humans understand the code. They are not executed by the computer, which means they do not affect how the program runs. A compiler or interpreter completely ignores comments.

Comments are mainly used to explain what the code is doing or why it is written in a certain way. They make programs easier to read, understand, and maintain—especially when the code becomes long or complex.

**Example (Python)**
``` python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a message on the screen
```

In the example above:

- The line starting with `#` is a comment.

- The comment explains what the code does.

- The computer only runs the `print()` statement.
