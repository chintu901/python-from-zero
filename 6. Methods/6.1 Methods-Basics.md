# Methods

In Python, **methods are functions that belong to an object**. They are designed to perform actions on the data stored inside that object. Unlike regular functions, methods are always called using an object, which makes their purpose clear and specific.

for example:

``` python
text = "car"
print(text.upper())     # CAR
```
Here:
- `"car"` is an object (a string)
- `upper()` is a method that belongs to string objects

Methods exist **because different types of data need different kinds of operations**. A string should support text-related actions, while a list should support adding or removing items. Methods group these actions directly with the data they work on.

This design makes Python code more readable, organized, and easier to understand.

> [!NOTE]
> Methods tie behavior directly to data, allowing objects to perform actions that make sense for their type.

## Methods vs Functions (Conceptual Difference)

Although methods and functions may look similar, they differ in **how they are used and what they act upon**.

**Functions:**
- Work independently
- Do not belong to any specific object
- Can accept any compatible data as arguments

``` python
length = len("Python")
```

**Methods:**
- Belong to a specific object
- Are called using that object
- Automatically operate on the object’s data

``` python
length = "python".__len__()
```
(Internally, this is what `len()` uses.)

> [!NOTE]
> Functions act independently, while methods are actions tied to specific objects, making code clearer and more structured.

## Why Objects Need Methods

In Python, data is not just stored—it is meant to be used and manipulated. Objects need methods so they can perform actions on their own data in a clean and logical way.

Instead of passing data around to different functions, methods allow:
- Data and behavior to stay together
- Operations to be specific to the object’s type
- Code to feel more natural and readable

For example, a string knows how to:
- Change its case
- Remove extra spaces
- Replace characters

``` python
name = "  Alex  "
clean_name = name.strip()
```

Here, `strip()` exists because **removing spaces is a string-specific behavior**. It wouldn’t make sense for every data type.

## How Methods Are Called

Methods are called using dot (`.`) notation, which clearly shows the relationship between an object and the action being performed.

Basic Syntax:

``` python
object.method()
```

Example:

``` python
text = " python".strip()
print(text.upper)   # PYTHON
```

**Why Dot Notation Matters**

Dot notation:
- Makes it clear which object is being acted upon
- Improves readability
- Helps avoid ambiguity in complex programs

When reading code like:

``` python
numbers.append(5)
```

You immediately know:
- `numbers` is being modified
- `append()` belongs to list objects


## Methods That Return Values vs Modify Data

Not all methods behave the same way. Some methods **return a new value**, while others **modify the original object directly**. Understanding this difference is important to avoid logical mistakes in your programs.

### Methods That Return Values

These methods:
- Do not change the original object
- Return a new value
- Are often used in expressions or assignments

Example (string method):

``` python
text = "python"
new_text = text.upper()

print(text)      # python
print(new_text)  # PYTHON
```

Here, `upper()` returns a new string but **leaves the original unchanged**.

### Methods That Modify Data (In-Place)

These methods:
- Change the original object
- Usually return None
- Are common with mutable objects like lists

Example (list methods):

``` python
num = [1, 2, 3]
num.append(4)
print(num)      # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
Here, `append()` modifies the list directly.

## Chaining Methods

Method chaining means calling **multiple methods one after another** in a single line. This is possible when each method returns an object that supports another method call.

Example:

``` python
text = "  python  "
result = text.strip().upper()

print(result)   # PYTHON
```

> [!NOTE]
> Method chaining allows multiple operations in one line, but it should be used only when it improves clarity—not when it complicates understanding.
