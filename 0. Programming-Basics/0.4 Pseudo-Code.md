# Pseudo - Code
Pseudocode is a simple way of step - by - step writing program logic using plain language (`English`). It is not written in any specific programming language and cannot be executed by a computer. Pseudocode is meant only for humans to understand how a program should work.

It focuses on what the program should do, not on how it should be written in a particular language. Because of this, pseudocode is easy to read, even for beginners.

Pseudocode is the intermediate state between an idea and its implementation(`code`) in a high-level language.

**Example:**

``` text
START
INPUT name
PRINT "Hello" + name
END
```
> Note: This pseudocode explains the logic of greeting a user, without using real programming syntax.

``` python
# Program of the pseudocode
name = input("Enter your name here: ")
print(f"Hello {name}")
```
## Why Use Pseudocode?

Pseudocode helps programmers plan and organize their thoughts before writing actual code. It allows you to think about the problem step by step without worrying about syntax errors.

**Benefits of Using Pseudocode**

- Helps in understanding the problem clearly

- Makes complex logic easier to break down

- Reduces mistakes while coding

- Saves time when writing real code

- Improves problem-solving skills

**Example Use Case**

Before writing a program, you can first write pseudocode like this:

``` text
START
ASK user for age
IF age >= 18
    PRINT "Eligible to vote"
ELSE 
    PRINT "Not eligible"
END
```

program:

``` python
age = int(input("What's your age? "))

if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
```
