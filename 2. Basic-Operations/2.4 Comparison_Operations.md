# Comparison Operations

Comparison operations are used to **compare two values** and **determine their relationship**.
They answer questions like “Are these values equal?” or “Is one value greater than another?”.

The result of every comparison in Python is a **Boolean value**: `True` or `False`.

``` python
age = 18
is_adult = age >= 18    # True
```

Now let’s look at all the comparison operators:

| Operators | Description | Syntax |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `==` | **Equal To:** checks if two values are equal. | `a == b` |
| `!=` | **Not Equal To:** checks if two values are not equal. | `a != b` |
| `>` | **Greater Than:** Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. | `a > b` |
| `<` | **Less Than:** Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. | `a < b` |
| `>=` | **Greater Than or Equal To:** Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value. | `a >= b` |
| `<=` | **Less Than or Equal To:** Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value. | `a <= b` |

**Example Program:**

``` python
# Sample values
a = 10
b = 20
c = 10

# Equality and inequality
print("a == c:", a == c)        # True
print("a != b:", a != b)        # True

# Relational operators
print("a > b:", a > b)          # False
print("a < b:", a < b)          # True
print("a >= c:", a >= c)        # True
print("a <= b:", a <= b)        # Ture

```

## Comparing Different Data Types

Comparison operations behave differently depending on the **data types** involved.
Understanding this is important to avoid **logical errors** and **runtime issues**.

### Comparing Numbers (int and float)

Python allows comparisons between integers and floating-point numbers.

``` python
print(10 == 10.0)   # True
print(5 < 7.5)      # True
```
Python converts numbers internally when needed to perform the comparison.

### Comparing Strings

Strings are compared **lexicographically**, meaning **character by character**, based on their **Unicode values**.

At a beginner level, it is enough to know that:
- `"apple" < "banana"` is `True`
- Uppercase and lowercase letters are different

``` python
print("cat" == "cat")       # True
print("Apple" < "apple")    # True
```

### Invalid Comparisons

Some data types cannot be meaningfully compared.

Examples of invalid comparisons:
- Number with string
- Unrelated object types

``` python
# This will cause an error
print(10 > "5")
```

## Chained Comparisons

Chained comparisons allow **multiple comparisons** in a **single expression**.
This is a Python feature that improves **readability** and **clarity**.

Instead of writing:
``` python
x > 5 and x < 10
```

Python allows:
``` python
5 < x < 10
```
Both expressions mean the same thing.

> [!NOTE]
> Chained comparisons let you check ranges cleanly and readably using a single expression.
