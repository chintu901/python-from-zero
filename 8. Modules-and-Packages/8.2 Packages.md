# Packages in Python

A **package** in Python is a way to **organize multiple related modules into a single folder**. When a project becomes large, keeping all code in one file or even many files in the same folder becomes confusing. Packages solve this problem by grouping related modules together.

In simple terms, a module is a **single file**, while a package is a **folder** that contains modules. Packages make projects easier to understand, maintain, and scale. They are widely used in real-world and professional Python applications.

Python treats a folder as a package when it contains a **special file called** `__init__.py`. This file tells Python that the folder should be handled as a package.

## Structure of a Python Package

A Python package follows a simple **folder-based** structure. Inside the package folder, you place all related **modules** and an `__init__.py` file. This structure helps Python understand how files are connected.

Example package structure:

``` bash
game/
│
├── __init__.py
├── player.py
├── ball.py
├── score.py
```

In this structure:
- `game` is the package
- `player.py`, `ball.py`, and `score.py` are modules
- `__init__.py` marks the folder as a package

You can then import these modules in another file like this:

``` python
from game import player
from game.ball import move_ball
```

## Why Packages Are Important

Packages are important because they help **manage large and complex Python projects**. As programs grow, handling many files in a single folder becomes confusing and error-prone. Packages **group related modules together**, making the project easier to understand and maintain.

Packages improve **code organization** by separating different parts of an application, such as logic, user interface, and data handling. They also help avoid naming conflicts, because **two modules with the same name can exist** in different packages. In professional development, packages make teamwork easier since different developers can work on different packages without interfering with each other’s code.

Overall, packages exist to make Python programs **clean**, **scalable**, and **professional**.

## Importing from Packages

Importing from packages allows you to use modules that are stored inside folders. Python provides multiple ways to do this, depending on how much of the package you need.

You can import a full module from a package:

``` python
import game.player

print(game.player.show_player())
```

You can also import a module directly from the package:

``` python
from game import ball
```

If you want to import a specific function or class from a module inside a package, you can do it like this:

``` python
from game.ball import move_ball
```
> [!NOTE]
> Python looks for packages in the current directory and in its system paths before importing them.

## Difference Between Module and Package

A **module** and a **package** are both used to organize Python code, but they serve different purposes and work at different levels of structure.

A **module** is a **single Python file** that contains code such as functions, classes, and variables. It is used when the code is small or when a specific functionality can be kept in one file. For example, a file named `math_utils.py` that contains mathematical functions is a module.

A **package** is a **collection of related modules stored inside a folder**. It is used when a project becomes large and needs better organization. A package groups multiple modules that work together. For example, a game package may contain modules like `player.py`, `ball.py`, and `score.py`.

In simple terms, a **module is a single file**, while a **package is a folder of files**. Modules handle individual features, and packages organize those features into a larger system.
