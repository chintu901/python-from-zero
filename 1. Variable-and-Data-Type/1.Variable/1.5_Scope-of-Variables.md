# Scope of Variable

[Variable scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/) refers to the **area of a program where a variable can be accessed or used**. In simple terms, it defines where a variable is visible and usable in the code.

A variable does not work everywhere in a program. Depending on where it is created, it may only be available in a specific part of the code, such as inside a function or throughout the entire program.

Example:

``` python
# Program here
```
In this example:

- `x` can be used anywhere in the program (global scope).

- `y` can only be used inside the `show()` function (local scope).

## Types of Variable scope

Variables can have different scopes depending on **where they are declared**. Understanding these types helps you know where a variable can be accessed and where it cannot.

There are four types of variable scope in python:

- Local Scope
- Enclosing Scope
- Global Scope
- Built - in Scope

### _Local Scope:_

A variable has local scope when it is declared inside a `function`.
Local variables can only be accessed within that function.

Example:
``` python
def Num():
    result = 30 # Local variable
    print(result)

Num() # Print(result) # error: result not defined
```
✔️ `result` is accessible only inside the `Num()` function.

### _Enclosing Scope:_

Enclosing scope refers to the scope of a variable defined in an outer function that is accessed by an inner (**nested**) function. This happens when one function is written inside another function.

In simple terms, an enclosing scope sits between **local scope and global scope**.

Example:
``` python
def outer():
    message = "Hello"  # enclosing scope variable

    def inner():
        print(message)  # accessing enclosing variable

    inner()

outer()
```

**Modifying Enclosing Variables:**

To modify a variable from the enclosing scope inside an inner function, Python uses the `nonlocal` keyword.

``` python 
def outer():
    count = 0 # enclosing scope variable

    def inner():
        nonlocal count  # accessing enclosing variable
        count += 1
        print(count)
    
    inner()
outer()
```

> Note: Without `nonlocal`, Python would treat `count` as a new local variable inside `inner()`.
