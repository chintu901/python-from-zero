# Loops

Loops are a programming concept that allows a block of code to run **repeatedly** without writing the same lines again and again. Instead of manually copying code, a loop tells the program **how many times** or **under what condition** the code should repeat.

In simple terms, a loop says:
“Do this task again until a certain rule is satisfied.”

Loops are used whenever a task follows a repeated pattern, such as:
- Printing values multiple times
- Processing items in a collection
- Repeating calculations

Without loops, programs would become longer, harder to read, and difficult to maintain.

> [!NOTE]
> Loops exist to handle repetition efficiently, allowing programs to work with any amount of data while staying simple and flexible.

## Types of Loops in Python

Python provides **two main types of loops**, each designed for a different kind of repetition. Choosing the right loop helps make code clearer and easier to control.

Types of loop:
- `for` loop
- `while` loop

### `for` loop

The `for` loop is used when you **know what to repeat** over—such as a sequence of values or a fixed range.

It is commonly used for:
- Looping through lists, strings, or tuples
- Repeating an action a specific number of times

``` python
items = [1, 2, 3]
for i in items:
    print(i)
```

### `while` loop

The `while` loop is used when **repetition depends on a condition**, not a predefined sequence.

It continues running as long as the condition remains true.

Common uses include:
- Waiting for user input
- Running a loop until a goal is reached

``` python
count = 0

while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Choosing Between `for` and `while`

- Use a `for` loop when working with sequences or known repetitions.

- Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations is unknown.

Understanding this difference helps write clear and intention-driven code.

> [!NOTE]
> Python offers `for` loops for sequence-based repetition and `while` loops for condition-based repetition, each suited to different programming needs.

## Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements allow you to **change the normal flow of a loop**. They give you more control over when a loop stops, skips, or pauses.

| Statement | Description | Syntax |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `Break` | The `break` statement immediately **ends the loop**, even if the loop condition is still true. | `break` |
| `Continue` | The `continue` statement **skips the remaining code** in the current loop iteration and moves to the next one. | `continue` |
| `Pass` | The `pass` statement does nothing but keeps the loop syntactically valid. | `pass` |

**Example:**

``` python
for number in range(1, 11):

    # Skip number 3
    if number == 3:
        continue

    # Placeholder for future logic
    if number == 5:
        pass

    # Stop the loop when number reaches 8
    if number == 8:
        break

    print(number)
```

## Infinite Loops

An infinite loop is a loop that **never stops running** on its own. This happens when the loop’s stopping condition is never met or never changes.

In most beginner programs, infinite loops occur by mistake, but in some cases, they are used intentionally (for example, in games or servers that must keep running).

### How Infinite Loops Happen

Infinite loops usually occur when:
- A while loop condition is always True
- The variable controlling the condition is never updated
- The stopping condition is written incorrectly

Example of an infinite loop:

``` python
count = 0
while < 3:
    print(count)
```
Here, count never changes, so the condition is always true.

### When Infinite Loops Are Useful

At an introductory level, it’s important to know that infinite loops can be **intentional**, such as:
- Waiting for user input continuously
- Running background services
- Game loops

These loops rely on `break` or external events to stop.

> [!NOTE]
> Infinite loops occur when a loop never reaches its stopping condition, so careful condition design and updates are essential to prevent unintended behaviour.

## Nested Loops

Nested loops are **loops placed inside other loops**. This means that for every single iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs completely.

Nested loops are useful when a task involves **working with multiple layers of data** or **repeating actions within repetitions**.

### How Nested Loops Work

The execution follows this order:
- The outer loop runs once
- The inner loop runs fully for that one outer iteration
- The outer loop moves to its next iteration
- The inner loop runs again

This pattern continues until the outer loop finishes.

``` python
for row in range(1, 4):
    for col in range(1, 4):
        print(f"Row {row}, Column {col}")
```

> [!NOTE]
> Nested loops allow repeated operations within repetitions, but they should be used carefully to keep code readable and efficient.
