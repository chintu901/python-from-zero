# Scope of Variable

[Variable scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/) refers to the **area of a program where a variable can be accessed or used**. In simple terms, it defines where a variable is visible and usable in the code.

A variable does not work everywhere in a program. Depending on where it is created, it may only be available in a specific part of the code, such as inside a function or throughout the entire program.

Example:

``` python
# Program here
```
In this example:

- `x` can be used anywhere in the program (global scope).

- `y` can only be used inside the `show()` function (local scope).

Variables can have different scopes depending on **where they are declared**. Understanding these types helps you know where a variable can be accessed and where it cannot.

There are four types of variable scope in python:

- Local Scope
- Enclosing Scope
- Global Scope
- Built - in Scope
