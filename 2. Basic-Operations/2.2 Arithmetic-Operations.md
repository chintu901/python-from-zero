# Arithmetic Operations

Python operators are fundamental for performing **mathematical calculations**. Arithmetic operators are **symbols** used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values. Arithmetic operators include addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`).

Arithmetic operations allow a program to work with numbers in a meaningful way. They take numeric values, apply a mathematical action.

``` python
total = 10 + 5
```

Through arithmetic operations, a program can: 
- Calculate totals 
- Measure differences 
- Update values 
- Transform raw numbers into useful information.

Without these operations, numbers in a program would remain isolated values with no practical use.

| Operations | Description | Syntax |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `+` | **Addition:** adds two operands | `x + y` |
| `-` | **Subtraction:** subtracts two operands | `x - y` |
| `*` | **Multiplication:** multiplies two operands | `x * y` |
| `/` | **Division (float):** divides the first operand by the second | `x / y` |
| `//` | **Division (floor):** divides two numbers and returns only the whole number part, removing the decimal portion. | `x // y` |
| `%` | **Modulus:** returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second | `x % y` |
| `**` | **Power:** Returns first raised to power second | `x ** y` |

**Example:**
``` python
# Initial values
a = 10
b = 3

# Arithmetic Operations
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b
floor_division = a // b
modulus = a % b
exponentiation = a ** b

# Display results
print("Addition:", addition)                # 13
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)          # 7
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)    # 30
print("Division:", division)                # 3.3333333333333335
print("Floor Division:", floor_division)    # 3
print("Modulus:", modulus)                  # 0.13
print("Exponentiation:", exponentiation)    # 100

```
## Order of Evaluation in Arithmetic Expressions

When an arithmetic expression contains **multiple operators**, Python must decide **which operation to perform first**.

This decision is based on a set of rules called **operator precedence**.

Understanding the order of evaluation is important because the **same numbers can produce different results** depending on how the expression is evaluated.

**How Python Evaluates Arithmetic Expressions:**

Python follows a fixed order while evaluating arithmetic expressions.

In general, Python evaluates:
- Expressions inside parentheses first  `()`.
- Exponentiation (`**`).
- Multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), floor division (`//`), and modulus (`%`).
- Addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).

``` python
result = 10 + 2 * 3
print(result)   # 16
```

Here, multiplication is performed before addition.

> [!NOTE]
> Python evaluates arithmetic expressions using a defined order of precedence, and parentheses should be used to control and clarify calculations.
