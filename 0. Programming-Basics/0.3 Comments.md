# Comments
Comments are text notes added to the program to provide explanatory information about the source code. They are used in a programming language to document the program and remind programmers of what tricky things they just did with the code and also helps the later generation for understanding and maintenance of code. The compiler considers these as non-executable statements. Different programming language uses a different way of including the comments in the source code.
