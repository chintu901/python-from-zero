## Sequence Data Type

Sequence data types in Python are used to store **multiple values** in a single variable in an ordered way. Each value in a sequence has a **fixed position**, called an `index`, which allows you to access elements easily.

Sequence data types are commonly used when you need to:

- Store a collection of data
- Access elements using position
- Loop through multiple values

**Key Features of Sequence Data Types:**

- **Ordered:** Elements maintain a specific order
- **Indexed:** Each element has an index (starting from 0)
- **Iterable:** Can be looped using a for loop
- **Supports slicing:** Can extract parts of the sequence

**Example:**

``` python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 10
```
> Note: Sequence data types allow you to work with multiple values efficiently and in an organized manner.

## Types of Sequence Data Types in Python

Python provides **two main sequence data types**, each designed for different use cases.

### 1. List (`list`):

Used to store multiple items in a single variable.

``` python
items = [1, 2, 3, "apple"]
```

- Mutable (can be changed)
- Can store mixed data types

### 2. Tuple (`tuple`)

Used to store multiple items that should not be changed.

``` python
coordinates = (10, 21)
```

- Immutable
- Faster than list

> Choosing the right sequence type helps you write **clean**, **efficient**, and **professional** Python code.
