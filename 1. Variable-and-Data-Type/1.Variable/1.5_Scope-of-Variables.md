# Scope of Variable

[Variable scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/) refers to the **area of a program where a variable can be accessed or used**. In simple terms, it defines where a variable is visible and usable in the code.

A variable does not work everywhere in a program. Depending on where it is created, it may only be available in a specific part of the code, such as inside a function or throughout the entire program.

Example:

``` python
# Program here
```
In this example:

- `x` can be used anywhere in the program (global scope).

- `y` can only be used inside the `show()` function (local scope).

## Types of Variable scope

Variables can have different scopes depending on **where they are declared**. Understanding these types helps you know where a variable can be accessed and where it cannot.

There are four types of variable scope in python:

- Local Scope
- Enclosing Scope
- Global Scope
- Built - in Scope

![Variable Scope Types](/res/variable-scope-types.png)

### _Local Scope:_

A variable has local scope when it is declared inside a `function`.
Local variables can only be accessed within that function.

Example:
``` python
def Num():
    result = 30 # Local variable
    print(result)

Num() # Print(result) # error: result not defined
```
✔️ `result` is accessible only inside the `Num()` function.

### _Enclosing Scope:_

Enclosing scope refers to the scope of a variable defined in an outer function that is accessed by an inner (**nested**) function. This happens when one function is written inside another function.

In simple terms, an enclosing scope sits between **local scope and global scope**.

Example:
``` python
def outer():
    message = "Hello"  # enclosing scope variable

    def inner():
        print(message)  # accessing enclosing variable

    inner()

outer()
```

**Modifying Enclosing Variables:**

To modify a variable from the enclosing scope inside an inner function, Python uses the `nonlocal` keyword.

``` python 
def outer():
    count = 0 # enclosing scope variable

    def inner():
        nonlocal count  # accessing enclosing variable
        count += 1
        print(count)
    
    inner()
outer()
```

> Note: Without `nonlocal`, Python would treat `count` as a new local variable inside `inner()`.

### _Global Scope:_

Global scope refers to variables that are declared outside of all functions. These variables are available throughout the entire program and can be accessed from anywhere, including inside functions.

Global variables are created when the program starts and remain in memory until the program ends.

Example:
``` python
total = 100  # global variable

def show_total():
    print(total)  # accessing global variable

show_total()
print(total)
```
In this example:

- `total` is a global variable

- It can be accessed both inside and outside the function

**Modifying Global Variables Inside a Function**
By default, a function can read a global variable but cannot modify it unless the `global` keyword is used.

``` python
count = 0  # global variable

def increase():
    global count
    count += 1

increase()
print(count)
```

Without the `global` keyword, Python would create a new local variable instead of modifying the global one.

> Note: Use global variables **sparingly**. Prefer passing values to **functions** instead.

### _Built - in Scope:_

Built-in scope refers to **variables and functions that are automatically available in Python** without importing or defining anything. These are provided by Python itself and can be used **anywhere in your program**.

Built-in scope is the last level Python checks when looking for a variable name.

**Examples of Built-in Variables and Functions:**

Some commonly used built-in names include:

- `print()`

- `len()`

- `type()`

- `input()`

- `int()`, `str()`, `float()`

- `True`, `False`, `None`

**Example:**

``` python
name = "Python"
print(len(name)) #Output: 6
```
Here:

- `print` and `len` come from the built-in scope

- You did not need to define them
