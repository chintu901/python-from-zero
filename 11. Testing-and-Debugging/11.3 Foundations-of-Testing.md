# Foundations of Testing

## Introduction to Software Testing

Debugging helps you fix problems after they occur.
Testing helps you prevent problems before users encounter them.

Software testing is the process of verifying that your code behaves as expected under different conditions. Instead of manually checking results, we write code that automatically checks other code.

Testing ensures:
- Correct functionality
- Code reliability
- Stability during changes
- Fewer production bugs
- Higher confidence when refactoring

In professional development, testing is not optional — it is a core practice.

### Why Testing Is Important

As programs grow:
- Code becomes interconnected
- Small changes can break existing functionality
- Manual checking becomes inefficient

Testing solves this by:
- Automatically verifying behavior
- Detecting regressions
- Acting as documentation for expected behavior

Testing turns assumptions into verifiable guarantees.

### Types of Testing (Overview)

Before diving deeper, it’s important to understand the main categories:

**1. Unit Testing**

Tests individual functions or small components.

**2. Integration Testing**

Tests how multiple components work together.

**3. System Testing**

Tests the entire application as a whole.

In this file, we focus primarily on unit testing, which is the foundation of reliable software.
