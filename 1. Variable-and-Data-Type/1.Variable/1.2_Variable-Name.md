# Variable Name
Variables are created to store the values and variables are noting but names that are given to the.

## Variable Naming Techniques
Variable naming techniques are essential for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Here are some common techniques and best practices for variable naming in Python:

**Descriptive Name:** Use names that describe the variable purpose, such as age, carname, or User_name.

**Case Sensitivity:** Variable names are case - sensitive in `Python`.
``` python
CAR = "Audi"
car = "TATA Nano"
print(CAR) # Output: Audi
print(car) # Output: TATA Nano
```
> Note: The variables `CAR` and `car` have different values because uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently.

**Avoid Reserved Keywords:** Ensure that variable names do not conflict with Python's reserved keywords. like `Print`, `float`,`class`, etc.

```python
class = 10 # ❌ this will throw error becouse "class" is a reserved word
```
```python
Student_Class = 10 # ✅ 
```

**Consistent Naming Conventions:** Choose a naming style (`camelCase`, `PascalCase`, `snake_case`, `kebab-case`) and stick with it throughout your

## Naming Conventions
The creator of the Python language himself, [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), Tell us to use `snake_case` for variable names. What is snake case? It's just a style for writing variable names. Here are some examples of different casing styles:

| Name |  Description  | Code | Language(s) that recommend it |
|:-----|:--------:|------:|------:|
| Snake Case   | All words are lowercase and separated by underscores | `num_new_users` |Python, Ruby, Rust|
| Camel Case   |  Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one  |`numNewUsers`|JavaScript, Java|
| Pascal Case   | Capitalize the first letter of each word |    `NumNewUsers` |C#, C++|
