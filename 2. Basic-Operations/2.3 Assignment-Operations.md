# Assignment Operations

In programming, **assignment** means giving a value to a variable.

Assignment operations are used to **store values in variables** so they can be used later in a program.
They form the foundation of how programs **remember** and **work with data**.

Without assignment, a program would not be able to:

- Store results of calculations
- Track changes in values
- Reuse data across different parts of the code

``` python
x = 10
```
- The value `10` is stored in the variable `x`
- The variable `x` now refers to that value
- The value can be reused or changed later

## Simple Assignment Operator (`=`)

The **simple assignment operator (`=`)** is used to **assign a value to a variable**.
It is one of the most frequently used operators in Python and is **essential for storing data**.

In Python, the assignment operator does **not** mean “equal to” as in mathematics.
Instead, it means **assign the value on the right to the variable on the left**.

``` python
x = 10 + 3
```
- `10 + 3` is evaluated first
- The result (`13`) is assigned to `x`

Don't mistake the = and == 
- `=` → assignment (stores a value)

- `==` → comparison (checks if two values are equal)

## Compound Assignment Operators

Compound assignment operators are used to **update a variable’s value** using an **operation** and **assignment** in a single step.

They make code shorter, cleaner, and easier to read.

| Operators | Description | Syntax |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `+=` | **Addition Assignment:** Adds a value to the variable and stores the result back. | `a += 2` |
| `-=` | **Subtraction Assignment:** Subtracts a value from the variable and updates it. | `a -= 1` |
| `*=` | **Multiplication Assignment:** Multiplies the variable by a value and stores the result. | `a *= 5` |
| `/=` | **Division Assignment:** Divides the variable by a value. | `a /= 2` |
| `//=` | **Floor Division Assignment:** Performs floor division and assigns the whole-number result. | `a //= 3` |
| `%=` | **Modulus Assignment:** Stores the remainder after division. | `a %= 2` |
| `**=` | **Exponent Assignment:** Raises the variable to a power and assigns the result. | `a **= 2` |

**Example Program:**

``` python
# Initial value
x = 10
print("Initial value:", x)      # 10

# Addition assignment
x += 5
print("After += 5:", x)         # 15

# Subtraction assignment
x -= 3
print("After -= 3:", x)         # 12

# Multiplication assignment
x *= 2
print("After *= 2:", x)         # 24

# Division assignment
x /= 4
print("After /= 4:", x)         # 6.0

# Floor division assignment
x //= 2
print("After //= 2:", x)        # 3.0

# Modulus assignment
x %= 3
print("After %= 3:", x)         # 0.0

# Exponent assignment
x **= 2
print("After **= 2:", x)        # 0.0

```

> [!NOTE]
> Compound assignment operators combine an operation and assignment into one step, making code shorter, clearer, and more maintainable.

## Multiple Assignment and Unpacking

Python allows assigning **multiple variables** in a **single line**, which makes code concise and expressive.

This feature is called **multiple assignment** or **unpacking**.

``` python
a, b = 5, 10
```

**Swapping Variables Using Unpacking:**

Python allows swapping values **without a temporary variable**.

``` python 
x = 3
y = 7

x, y = y, x
```

**Common Unpacking Mistakes:**

Unpacking requires the number of variables to match the number of values.

Common mistake:
- Too many variables
- Too few values
- Mismatched structure

``` python
a, b = 1
```

Solution:

``` python
a = b = 1
```

> Multiple assignment and unpacking allow Python to assign and swap values cleanly, improving code clarity and efficiency.
