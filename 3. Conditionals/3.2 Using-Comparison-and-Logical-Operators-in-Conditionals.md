# Using Comparison and Logical Operators in Conditionals

Comparison operators are used to **evaluate relationships between values**, such as **checking equality**, **order**, or **limits**. Logical operators are used to **combine or modify those comparison results**. On their own, each is useful—but together, they allow a program to express real-world decision logic.

Most real problems cannot be solved with a single comparison. For example, granting access might require a user to be logged in and have the correct role, or an action might be allowed if a value is within a range. Comparison operators produce **Boolean results**, and logical operators **combine those results into a final decision**.

Using both together allows conditionals to stay **clear**, **compact**, and **meaningful**, rather than splitting logic across many separate checks.

**Comparison and Logical Operators Help in:**

By using comparison and logical operators together, a program can:
- Evaluate multiple conditions at the same time
- Express complex rules in a readable way
- Make accurate decisions based on data

``` python
age = 19
have_voter_id = True

if age >= 18 and have_voter_id:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("You can't vote")
```

## Using Comparison Operators Inside `if` Statements

Comparison operators are most commonly used **inside** `if`, `elif`, **and** `else` **structures** to decide which block of code should run. These operators compare values and return `True` or `False`, which directly controls the flow of the program.

Common comparison operators include:
- `==` (equal to)
- `!=`(not equal to)
- `>` and `<` (greater than, less than)
- `>=` and `<=` (boundary-inclusive checks)

``` python
age = 21

if age >= 18:
    print("Access granted")
```

## Combining Conditions with Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to **combine multiple comparison results into a single condition**.
They allow a program to make decisions that depend on **more than one rule at the same time**.

After comparisons convert values into `True` or `False`, logical operators decide how those results should be **interpreted together**.

Common logical operators include:

- `and`: used when all conditions must be true for the final result to be true.
- `or`: used when at least one condition must be true.
- `not`: used to invert a Boolean result.

``` python
age = 19
has_id = True
is_banned = False

if (age >= 18 and has_id) and not is_banned:
    print("Access granted")
elif age < 18 or not has_id:
    print("Access denied: Requirements not met")
else:
    print("Access denied: User is banned")
```

## Using Parentheses for Readability and Correctness

When conditions become complex, parentheses help **control how expressions are evaluated** and make the logic easier to understand. Even though Python follows a fixed order of evaluation, relying only on that order can make conditions confusing and error-prone.

Parentheses allow you to group related conditions, showing clearly how **different parts of the logic are connected**.

``` python
age = 17
has_id = True
is_member = False

if (age >= 18 and has_id) or is_member:
    print("Access allowed")
```

**Parentheses Improve Maintainability:**

Parentheses make code easier to:
- Debug
- Modify later
- Understand by other developers (or your future self)

This becomes especially important in professional codebases, where clarity matters as much as correctness.
