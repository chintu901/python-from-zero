# Bitwise Operations

Bitwise operations are operations that work **directly on the binary representation of numbers**.
Instead of treating numbers as whole values (like 5 or 10), bitwise operations look at numbers as a **sequence of bits** (0s and 1s) and perform operations on each bit **individually**.

Computers internally store and process all data in **binary form**. Bitwise operations exist to give programmers **direct control over this low-level representation** when needed. While many programs do not use bitwise operations daily, they are essential in areas such as **performance optimization**, **system programming**, and **working with flags** or **encoded data**.

**What Bitwise Operations Help a Program Do?**

Through bitwise operations, a program can:
- Manipulate data at the lowest level
- Perform fast operations on numbers
- Work efficiently with compact data representations
- Control and check individual flags or settings

Even at a beginner level, understanding bitwise operations helps build a strong foundation of how computers really work.

## Understanding Bits and Binary Numbers (Basics)

A bit is the **smallest unit** of data in a computer.
It can have only one of **two values**: `0` or `1`.

Computers use bits because **electronic circuits naturally represent two states** (on and off). Multiple bits together form **binary numbers**, which are used to represent all data—numbers, text, images, and more.

**Binary Representation of Numbers:**

In binary, each position represents a power of 2.

``` python
Decimal: 5
Binary:  101
```

This means:
- `1 × 2²`
- `0 × 2¹`
- `1 × 2⁰`

## Bitwise AND (`&`) Operator

The bitwise AND operator **compares each bit of two numbers** and returns `1` **only if both bits are** `1` at the same position.
If either bit is `0`, the result is `**`.

This operator is often used when a program needs to check **specific bits** or **enforce strict conditions** at the binary level.

``` python
a = 5   # Binary: 101
b = 3   # Binary: 011

print(a & b)    # 1
```

Binary comparison:

``` bash
  101
& 011
-----
  001  → 1
```

## Bitwise OR (`|`) Operator

The bitwise OR operator **compares bits** and **returns** `1` **if at least one of the bits is** `1`.

It is used when a program wants to combine bits from two values.

``` python
a = 5   # Binary: 101
b = 3   # Binary: 011

print(a | b)    # 7
```

Binary comparison:

``` bash
  101
| 011
-----
  111  → 7
```

## Bitwise XOR (`^`) Operator

The bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator returns `1` **only when the bits are different**.
If both bits are the same, the result is `0`.

This makes XOR useful for detecting differences.

``` python
a = 5   # Binary: 101
b = 3   # Binary: 011

print(a ^ b)    # 6
```

Binary comparison:

``` bash
  101
^ 011
-----
  110  → 6
```

## Bitwise NOT (`~`) Operator

The bitwise NOT operator **flips all bits** of a number.
Every `1` becomes `0`, and every `0` becomes `1`.

In Python, this operation produces negative numbers because of how integers are stored.

``` python
a = 5
print(~a)   # -6
```

Explanation:

``` bash
~5  →  -6
```

## Bitwise Shift Operators (`<<` and `>>`)

Bitwise shift operators **move bits left or right** within a number.
Shifting bits **changes the numeric value** in a predictable way.

### Left Shift (`<<`)

Shifts bits to the left, **effectively multiplying by powers of 2**.

``` python
a = 3   # Binary: 011
print(a << 1)   # 6
```

Explanation:

``` bash
 3     6
011 → 110  → 6
```

### Right Shift (`>>`)

Shifts bits to the right, **effectively dividing by powers of 2**.

``` python
a = 8   # Binary: 1000
print(a >> 2)   # 2
```

Explanation:

``` bash
8        2
1000 → 0010  → 2
```

## When and Why to Use Bitwise Operations (Intro Level)

Bitwise operations are not used in every program, but they are **very powerful in specific situations**. They exist to give programmers **efficient** and **precise control** over data at the binary level.

At a beginner level, the goal is not to use bitwise operations everywhere, but to understand when they make sense and why they exist.

**When Bitwise Operations Are Useful?**

Bitwise operations are commonly used when a program needs to:
- Work with flags or settings stored in a single number
- Perform fast, low-level calculations
- Manipulate binary data directly
- Interact with system-level or hardware-related data

These use cases take advantage of how computers naturally work with bits.

**Why Bitwise Operations Exist?**

Bitwise operations exist because:
- Computers process data in binary
- Bit-level operations are faster and more memory-efficient
- Some problems are easier to solve using bits instead of full values

They allow complex information to be represented and processed using fewer resources.

### Beginner Perspective

As a beginner:
- You do not need to master bitwise operations immediately
- You should recognize them when you see them
- You should understand their purpose and basic behavior

This understanding becomes important later when working with:
- Performance-sensitive code
- System programming
- Advanced data manipulation

> Bitwise operations are specialized tools used for efficient, low-level data manipulation, and understanding their purpose prepares you for advanced programming concepts.
