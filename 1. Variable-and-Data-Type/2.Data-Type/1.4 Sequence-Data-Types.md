## Sequence Data Type

Sequence data types in Python are used to store **multiple values** in a single variable in an ordered way. Each value in a sequence has a **fixed position**, called an `index`, which allows you to access elements easily.

Sequence data types are commonly used when you need to:

- Store a collection of data
- Access elements using position
- Loop through multiple values

**Key Features of Sequence Data Types:**

- **Ordered:** Elements maintain a specific order
- **Indexed:** Each element has an index (starting from 0)
- **Iterable:** Can be looped using a for loop
- **Supports slicing:** Can extract parts of the sequence

**Example:**

``` python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 10
```
> Note: Sequence data types allow you to work with multiple values efficiently and in an organized manner.
