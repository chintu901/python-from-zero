# Conditionals 

Conditionals allow a program to **make decisions** based on given conditions.
Instead of running every line of code in the same way, conditionals enable a program to **choose different paths of execution** depending on whether a condition is true or false.

In real life, decisions are made all the time: if it rains, you carry an umbrella; if the traffic light is red, you stop. Programming follows the same idea. Conditionals help translate this kind of decision-making logic into code.

Conditionals in Python work using **Boolean values** (`True` and `False`). A condition is evaluated, and based on the result, Python decides whether a specific block of code should run. This makes programs flexible, interactive, and capable of handling different situations.

Through conditionals, a program can:
- Respond differently to different inputs
- Validate data before processing it
- Control the flow of execution
- Handle multiple possible outcomes

``` python
age = 19

if age >= 18:
    print("Bro..You have earn now!!").
else:
    print("You are safe.. for now")
```

## The `if` Statement

The if statement is the most basic form of conditional logic in Python.
It allows a program to **run a block of code only when a condition is true**.

When Python encounters an `if` statement, it evaluates the condition.
If the condition results in `True`, the indented block under the if statement is executed.
If the condition is `False`, Python skips that block entirely.

### How the `if` Statement Works

An if statement consists of:
- A condition that evaluates to `True` or `False`
- A colon (`:`) that marks the start of the block
- An indented block of code that runs only if the condition is true

``` python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote now.. Old")
```
### Why Indentation Matters

Python uses indentation instead of braces to define blocks of code.
This makes code easier to read but also means indentation must be correct.

Incorrect indentation can:
- Cause errors
- Change program behavior
- Break logical flow

## The `else` Statement

The `else` statement is used to define what should happen when an `if` condition is false.
It provides an **alternative path**, ensuring the program handles both outcomes.

An `else`statement must always come after an `if` statement and does not have its own condition.

``` python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote now.. Old")
else:
    print("The county is safe..")
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `else` statement improves code clarity by explicitly handling the “false” case, but it is optional—an `if` statement can exist without it if no alternative action is needed. ✅

## The `elif` Statement

The `elif` statement (short for **else if**) is used when a program needs to **check multiple conditions one after another**.
It allows you to test more than one possibility without writing separate if statements.

An `elif` statement is always placed between if and else. Python evaluates conditions from **top to bottom** and executes the first condition that is true, then skips the rest.

### How the elif Statement Works

An if–elif–else structure follows this flow:
- Python checks the `if` condition first
- If it is False, Python checks the next `elif`
- This continues until a condition is True
- If none are True, the `else` block (if present) runs

``` python
marks = 72

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: D")
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `elif` statement allows multiple conditions to be checked in sequence, and because Python stops at the first match, the order of conditions matters for correct results.

## Multiple `if` Statements Vs `elif` Statements

Using `elif` instead of multiple separate `if` statements helps a program make **clear, controlled decisions**. While both approaches can check multiple conditions, they behave very differently and have important practical differences.

When you use multiple independent `if` statements, each condition is checked **separately**. This means more than one block of code can run, even when logically only one outcome should occur. This can lead to incorrect results and confusing behavior.

In contrast, an `if–elif–else` structure ensures that **only one block of code is executed**. Once a condition is true, Python skips the remaining checks. This makes the program easier to reason about and prevents unintended outputs.

**Using multiple `if` statements:**

When you write multiple if statements, **each condition is checked independently**.
This means more than one block of code can be execute.

``` python
marks = 85

if marks >= 80:
    print("Excellent")
if marks >= 60:
    print("Passed")
```
Output:

``` bash
Excellent
Passed
```

**Using `elif` statement:**
- Conditions are checked in order
- Only one block executes
- Clear decision flow
- Easier to read and maintain

``` python
marks = 85

if marks >= 80:
    print("Excellent")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Passed")
```

Output:

``` bash
Excellent
```

### When Multiple if Statements Are Acceptable

Multiple `if` statements are still useful when:
- Conditions are independent
- Multiple actions should happen at the same time

The key is choosing the structure that matches the logic of the problem.

``` python
marks = 82
attendance = 68

# First decision block: grading system
if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: C")

# Second decision block: attendance status
if attendance >= 85:
    print("Attendance: Excellent")
elif attendance >= 70:
    print("Attendance: Good")
else:
    print("Attendance: Needs Improvement")
```

> [!NOTE]
> Use `elif` when conditions are mutually exclusive and only one outcome should occur; use multiple `if`statements only when all matching conditions should run independently.
